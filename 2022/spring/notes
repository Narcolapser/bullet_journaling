It is theoretically possible for 5 months to be represented in a season. So I need a way to capture that. Provided a range of dates I need to create a list of lists. The inner lists is a set of strings with a blank string representing a non-date, i.e. a filler in the calendar before the month starts, and numbers representing days. 

I'm fairly certain I can't use variables in the templates them selves, so it's not just calendars I need to make, it's the weekly rows. So I've got a list of lists of lists. Or a list of months and each month is a list of weeks.
