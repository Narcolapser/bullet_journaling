She has a baby!

Entry

Yesterday was pretty good. But the two biggest problems persist, uninstall codes and issues with time zones. There was an outage in staging yesterday so I don't know if my latest round of fixes fixed it.
After work... uh. What did I do... Oh right. Went out side so Lucy could play. While I was out there I did some more of the de-winterizing. I put the hose in the back yard on it's hook and brought out the front yard hose and installed it. Then I watered the flowers and blue berry bushes in hopes that it would be good for them all getting started this season. Hopefully we can have some nice healthy growth on our blueberry bushes this year. 
After that I came in and made supper. After supper we played some video games. I'm not enjoying Kirby Star Allies that much. It's a quaint game but is just a little to easy for my tastes I think. After we beat a world I went and checked on my 3D printed yoshi. It was done but I needed to remove the supports. Unfortunately in the process of removing the supports I broke it's head off and broke the whole figure off the book end. Fortunately nothing a little super glue couldn't fix. 
After that I played some Valheim until it was bed time. I found an island that might make a great base but it looks like its going to be to big. Darn. It also has a troll cave, a dwarf spawner, and a tomb on it. It's a fairly hoppin place!
Lucy was trying to go back and forth between milk and screens last night. She watched dancing music. Then came to bed for right milk, then wanted snowy day. We let her have it after some reluctance but told her if she did she wouldn't get left milk. She went and watched snowy day and after a few repitiions came and asked for milk. When she was denied she througha huge fit. I ended up walking with her to try to calm her back down. She eventually relented and laid back down with dancing music on my tablet. I let it run basically the whole night. At 5 am she woke and decided she was done with it, brought me my tablet and then we let her have some milk. It was a bit of an experiment. Would she stay in her bed all night if everytime she woke up, and she did at least once, she immediately saw her dancing music and could go back to sleep? It seemed to help but was not enough to get through the whole night. But never the less we did get our bed to our selves till 5. That was nice. I actually feel a little rested this morning.  
### April 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 1 week till our next ultra sound
2. A new bullet journal with page numbers
3. My first desk drawer shelf complete

Thing I love about Megan: 
Kept Lucy for Sunday school yesterday

Entry

Friday wasn't to bad. I didn't come up with enough shinanigans. Sabrina came over relatively early and helped out again, which was nice because I was in T3 time most of the morning. Unfortunately I feel asleep for the first chunk of it. After that I mostly experimented with Grafana for the rest of the day.
After work I worked on my journal a bit and I forget what else. 
Saturday was mostly about working on my journal. I got it done and into a makeshift press by 5:30. We grilled out and had a nice relaxing evening for the most part.
Sunday was pretty restful. We went to church and Lucy decided to stay for sunday school since Arthie was going to be there. I brought back V's box from Amanda's and proceeded to do a little cleaning before I relaxed with a book. We now have just a rocking chair left for out of place things in the basement. Doing great! My weight bench area suddenly has opened up quite a bit.
After church we mostly relaxed. Lucy slept to dancing music and I played Valheim. I've really taken to using Core Wood for my constructions. It is sturdy but adds a great look also. I built some bridges and a massive store house. At the end of the evening I ran off to find some more copper. I dug a shaft straight down and setup my crafting table and forge but then a troll found me. Laughably he couldn't do anything since I was in a tiny hole. I dug out a little bit so I could hit him with my bow but unfortunately that was enough to allow him to fall into the hole. I died, but now I had a trapped troll! It was fish in a barrel. I ran back to the copper mine and took pot shots until he died. 
This morning after our really long retro I went down stairs and TADA! my first set of desk shelves was complete! I'll have to examine it more this evening. But it's looking good, or at least good enough. It's a little smaller than my existing drawers, which might be fine as I could potentially just pring more drawers.
### April 5

Things I'm thankful for


1. Sleep
2. A new journal
3. A car

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is starting to be able to handle Lucy again.

Entry

Yesterday was mostly meeting in the morning and timezones in the afternoon. The first of my desk drawer shelves finished printing. There are some flaws with the final result but overall I'm pleased. I tried to update it to fix the problems but that introduced new problems so I gave up and this morning I started the same print for the other side of my desk. If I can let it print for 14 hours today I can get the print done with only two stops for not printing over night for safety. Then I'll have finally completed the largest task in this project. 
After work was tumbling class. Then we grilled for supper. I did the binding on my journal, and then I did my weight lifting. I spotted a problem in my journal, I have "weight lifting: arms" where it shoudl be legs. woops. nothing's perfect. Then I played Valheim till it was bed time. 
I'm really tired today for some reason. I think I slept ok, but I feel like I didn't sleep at all. It's frustrating. And Lucy woke at 7 so I didn't get any peace and quiet to myself this morning. 
### April 6

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good night's sleep
2. Putting Lucy back to bed
3. Budget automations starting to pay off.

Thing I love about Megan: 
If she's nervous about our little one, she's not showing it, and that encourages me.

Entry

I think I finally got the timezones issue fixed. 
Had a dental appointment yesterday. Appearently I have another cavity. I went so long with no cavities, all the way through college, and now I've got a bunch. I feel ashamed. 
After work I checked on my next shelving unit, unfortunately the print failed. The spool came off it's holder and as a result the printer went for probably nearly an hour without filament. :c I've restarted the print this morning, hopefully it complete successfully this time. 
Gregg came by to measure windows yesterday. We are moving towards replacing our windows early fall at long last. It will be nice having windows that aren't rotting to pieces this coming winter. 
Had supper and then I started working on the budget while Megan took Lucy to the hospital. We thought she might have a UTI. I wasn't convinced, but I fully admit I'm a horrible judge here. I loaded in the amazon receipts and then the walmart receipts. I was planning on doing some upgrades to the walmart parser but discovered that beautiful soup does not have xpath. Troublesome. So I just did a quick hack. Over all the automations worked great last night. I was really pleased. 
After that I gave Lucy a bath and then it was bed time.
### April 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun games with Ben
2. Rest starting to bring life back
3. Tulips that are coming up quite nicely.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Humble

Entry

Yesterday I think we finally got uninstall code issues sorted. Huzzah! Thought this morning it sounds like we are in a code freeze now. So we'll see how long it will take now to get that merged. 
I had a conversation with Ray about career advancement. It was a useful conversation. It's making me re-assess what exactly my objective is. I think at this point I am still striving to become a better programmer specifically, but it showed me that if one of my metrics for that is becoming a developer level 3, I've got to learn more than just how to code. 
After work we went out for supper. Megan was wiped out. Lucy never napped. It wasn't a great evening. We got home and Lucy watched Bluey for basically the rest of the evening and so I worked on organizing my desk some more since I could do that with Bluey playing. Played Valheim with Ben. We beat the Elder. I continued my sailing around our island. It's a large island. We now though are supposed to go to the swamp next. I'm excited because this means we'll finally be able to get a stone cutter and be able to build stone buildings.
### April 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The ability to stop my printer when we are gone/asleep
2. Motivation to exercise
3. A sharp mind

Thing I love about Megan: 
A sharp mind

Entry

Yesterday I mostly watched videos on Influx DB and attempted to use the query language to make useful queries for useful dashboards.
After work, I did my exercise, then relaxed a little until it was time for misson's team meeting. That ended up taking the entire evening. But there was some good discussion. 
### April 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy
2. Megan
3. Hope

Thing I love about Megan: 
Brought us Lucy

Entry

Lots of meetings in the morning of friday. Then lots of grafan dashboard experimenting. I got a scripts runs/errors pair of panels made.
I forget what I did after work. I think I put a fair bit of emphasis in getting more of my drawers done for my desk re-org project. Saturday I made canned cinammion rolls. I'd call them cinammon pastries, they were ok. I'm not sure we'll get them again. Went to the dump, we were loaded to the gills so it was nice to get back down to empty. I think in the future I'm going to forbid anything that isn't a bag from going into our big bins, everything else can go into the garage bin. That should help keep those big bins clean. I come back to whether this is really worth the money we are saving all the time. And I want to put down in writing the comment that it isn't about saving money at this point. Yes, that's nice, we save like 140$ a year, but the life style it encourages is kind of the bigger deal I think. The trash isn't a mysterious place where you put things and they just go away, I want my children to understand, this is the dump, this is where our trash goes. It also encourages us to recycle more and compost to keep our total amount of trash down.
After that I worked on a couple random things. One of which was cleaning out the closet. I made an inital pass clearing out all the stuff of mine in the closet that I don't need/want any more. The inistial pass removed probably 3/5ths of it. Not bad.
Sunday was pretty good. We went to church and came home. Had lunch and I played some Valheim. I paused for a little to make some face plates for my desk drawers and started printing them. The rest of my Gray filament came as well, but I wanted to get some of the face plates done first so I could actually finish some of the drawers. Sunday evening we watched "hiden Figures" which was quite enjoyable. Only a little preechy I thought until we looked up some of the historical inaccuracies and found they played fast and loose with some of the hardest hitting parts of the movie. So in reality it was more preechy than it felt. 
Monday was hard. Around 5 in the morning Megan officially misscaried. Judging by the size of the fetus which we happened to recover the child probably had died a week earlier. This really foobarred our plans for the day since we were going to go for an ultrasound. It wasn't unexpected, but it's still not happy. Megan got up from the bed and reported bleeding at 5 and I ran to get her paper towels. I spotted a few spots of blood on the floor and went to clean them up and froze. I starred at those few dots of blood for probably 2-3 minutes thinking that this was all I was going to get to see of my child. It hurt. I've lost 6 children now. Megan eventually called me and I wiped the spots and went to join her. She showed me the fetus at that point. So I was happy I got to see more than just a few red dots. I saw the little tiny fingers, they eyes, and a cute little smile. My poor child. I will see you some day. 
We went to the hospital with the fetus and handed it off to the genetic therapist who will send it off for genetic testing. Hopefully we'll be able to get some further insight into the issue and be able to prevent further miscariages. 
### April 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy
2. Megan
3. Working from home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is recovering just fine

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. I got a couple things done, which is good. The weather was lovely. Much better than what it is today. After work I ran my shorter distance and managed to do it two minutes faster than last friday. Which makes sense considering I didn't have my legs worn out from Thursday's Leg exercises at that point.
I worked on replacing Gotify with notification from home assistant. I've got the information for such streaming into home assistant but it isn't yet providing notifications. Progress. After that I Gave Lucy a bath. In hind sight it was a pretty short day. 
### April 14

Things I'm thankful for


1. The chain saw working for a little bit.
2. A 3D printer
3. A lovely wife

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has energy again

Entry

Yesterday morning worked for quite a while with Justin. Making sure the batching PR was up to snuff. We also fixed a race issue in client api. After lunch I put up a PR for fixing the error message we were getting that headers can't be set after a response is sent. 
After work I was expected to have the Lumber Lad come and help break up the logs. But he chickened out, probably because he came to his senses. I don't blame him. I went out and extracted one of the 3 logs though. I cut a stool off of it, which managed to get the log light enough for me to topple. Progress. I tried to cut another stool off of it but by this time my chain saw was not helpful again. I don't know what made it work for a little and then not work so well. But it was enough. I toppled and swivled the log until it was into the mulch bed. It will serve as a bench now. The other two logs I'll have the tree service come take. 
Took a shower and played Valheim with Ben. Our cooperative game is going slower I think than either of our personal games. Sort of. My personal game is still behind since I haven't beaten the elder yet. I really want to so I can get some iron and make a stone cutter already. Then I can make stone walls, floor, and buildings. 
### April 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Online Guides
2. A good night's sleep
3. A chance to leave Lucy for a bit. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is always looking forward with Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday accomplished a few more little things. It's just a bug hunt right now at work. Kinda refreshing having little challenges which can be overcome in an afternoon.
After work Megan and I went and had supper by our selves while my Mom watched over Lucy. It was indeed nice to get away for a bit and have some time to our selves. That evening though we still played video games as usual. It was overall a pretty quite day. 
### April 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A long weekend
2. Nearing completion of desk re-org project
3. Patience. :grumpycat:

Thing I love about Megan: 
Not sure, I've said a lot, I don't want to just say something without having actual meaning behind it.

Entry

Yesterday was a nice quiet day for the most part. In the morning I made breakfast boritos as was planned. Man, I'm already forgetting what I did in the morning. I think I continued to work on getting the rear hose electric valve back into home assistant. For lunch we had left overs. After lunch I had a Zigbee connected LED light bulb and a set of ultrasonic range finders. I tried setting up the bulb with our Eeros but, SURPRISE!, the zigbee hubs in them are dependant on Amazon cloud. *eye roll*. So I purchased a Zigbee USB adapter. That will be coming wednesday and I'll set up the RPi with that when it comes. I'll use that as my first experiment into Zigbee devices before I go and buy wall switches for the bathrooms. 
I took a while getting my computer to communicate with an ESP8266, in the end it was a power only USB cable causing the problem. *eye roll* it was a bit of an annoying day working on home automations. I got the ultrasonic sensor working with an Arduino. So my next endevour is to get it to work with a ESP8266. That shouldn't be to hard but I'm also learning to use ESPHome at the same time. So this is taking a little longer than I would have hoped. I expected the install into the garage to be the longest part of this process, silly me. I may still give up and just write the code necessary to do all the work manually. Actually, that's probably a good idea since I'm not expecting this to be more complicated than other things I'll be doing in the future. Those will mostly be just sensors.
I remember what I did most of the morning now, I read my microservices book.
We had supper, we went to the good friday service. After we got home I got my MQTT broker back up and running and then made doughnut dough. Lucy rattled me a little while she was helping me.
### April 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Christ's victory over death
2. A relaxing weekend
3. A useful troll in Valheim

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes wonderful creative food.

Entry

Saturday I made Doughnuts and mostly in the morning read books. Had to get caught up on my reading. In the afternoon I worked on my range finder for the garage for a while until my brain felt drained. Then I played Valheim. I spent most of the time atempting to establish a base near the Elder and recover my lost equipment in the plains. I got kinda lost in this activity and didn't accomplish much else productive on saturday. It was nice to relax a bit though.
Sunday was a pretty relaxing day, aside from the 6:10 wakeup call for the sunrise service. After said service Lucy and I came home and I prepared for lunch by cutting some ham and pineapple. Then I played some valheim. I continued my efforts to recover my lost equipment. I got to the deathsquittos and killed one, then died, then died again, then died a third time. Then, when I was running back I happened upon a troll. "Great, and me with no armor." Then I fell into the entrance of a burrial chamber and had to run past the skeletons. The troll turned and crushed the skelies, and then I realized he could be super useful. I proceeded to have him chase me all the way to the beach where the deathsquittos promptly turned to attack him. To my delight, and some what amazement, he promptly killed them. The three of them though nearly killed him. He was within about 3 bow shots of death. I Gathered my things as a fulling came up and finished the troll off. I finished off said fulling and ran back. I was unable to recover the resources from my boat, but that's tollerable for the recover of a level 2 pick axe, full set of bronze armor, etc, that I did recover. I then put the game aside and played with Lucy until my mother arrived. 
We went to church, came home and had a lovely lunch. Megan setup a easter egg hunt in the form of a scavenger hunt for Lucy. She was tickled beyond belief by this. She then spent most of the rest of the day setting up or asking to do easter egg hunts.
After my mom and Amanda left we settled down. I took a nap. Then played more Valheim. This time venturing into the swamp to get a couple of items for making better foods to fight the Elder with. The tiny patch of swamp I was exploring boarders a plains biome and so I ran across a deathsquitto there to. Needless to say I BOOKED it out of there.
Cleaned the kitchen and made pizza. We couldn't think of any movies we wanted to watch that Lucy would let us watch so we played FFXII last night instead. It was kinda nice. We are actually getting into the mechanics of the battle system now and it's starting to get interesting. 
### April 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Finishing my though on garage door controller
2. Some DS games cheap
3. Nearing completion on desk project

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took me up on my afternoon Rendevoxous.

Entry

Yesterday I had a bit of catch up to do. After that I mostly worked on SonarQube. I tried to get it running locally on my machine so see if I could see the output. It said everything was great. So that doesn't help me with getting this to work in github. *sigh* 
After work I did my weight lifting. And I printed some of the remaining face plates for my desk. I have about 4 hours worth of face plate left to print then I will have a mostly complete desk drawer project. I'll be able to check that one off my quarterly objectives.
I tried to work on the garage door open project last night as well but got continually interupted. One interuption was going and picking up a handful of DS games from some one in town. Huzzah! A few more checked off. I did get my nodemcu sending status updates to MQTT in a form that homeassistant understood. So I got the basic idea sorted there. I'm having issues where if I try to power multiple ultra sonic range finders my node suffers a brown out. So I'm looking for ways to provide the necessary power without loosing the ability to compute. I'm still hoping for 5 range finders providing door position and movement info. 
Yesterday was the first day of potty training. We had 2 or 3 accidents in the morning and afternoon. But by evening it finally clicked. Lucy managed to notice her body needing the potty and peed in the potty 3 times! We are pretty hopeful at this point. 
### April 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain cometh!
2. Lucy learning to potty train
3. A warm inside

Thing I love about Megan: 
Long Blonde Hair

Entry

Yesterday at work I learned about github workflows. Attempted to get SonarQube working. And assisted in the debugging of an auth issue.
After work I didn't run, it was to cold. I did set about processing the ham through, down into smaller bits for freezing to use later. My desk project officially concluded. There is still little clean up things and tweaks I want to make, but the drawers are officially complete with panels for all! Huzzah!
I was attempting to figure out why my node wasn't able to handle more than 1 ultrasonic sensor. Turns out I had wired it backwards. I thing I melted the solder on the sensor. Woops. It seems fine though. I can how in earnest attempt to making a multi-sensors garage door controller. I'm hoping I'll be able to do both doors with one Node. I've got a little bit of fiddling left to figure out to get there though. And hopefully I'll be able to print some nice cases for all this as well. 
### April 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucking out on buying the correct Zigbee adapter
2. Tasty Doughnuts all week!
3. Determiniation to get exercise for a healthy body

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks deeply about stories.

Entry

Yesterday at work I read up on backstage, and requested and was granted permissions to github as an admin, and looked into making some updtes to the configure_repositories script. But the most interesting part of the day was when I was working with Andrew Imeson, one of our security guys. He's the first person to recognize the Brave icon I have as decoration on my wall behind me. We had a bit of a conversation about privacy and password managers. It was fun.
After work I bucked up the courage to do the run I was supposed to do Tuesday but for the cold. I started off taking the 3.1m route, but only managed 2.1m. My heart was aching by the time I turned the corner to come down plum street so I slowed to a walk for a while there. I was up to 175bpm. I think it's one of the hardest I've pushed myself. I'm still not getting that "runners high" effect. Perhaps this exercise buisness would be easier if I did.
After running we had supper, then we went on a walk, then I made some more frosting/glaze for the remaining donuts. I was hoping to do some productive work on home automation after supper but I was pretty wiped by this point and it was only a few minutes till games with Ben so I just opened Valheim and enjoyed myself. 
### April 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A fun team at work
2. A lovely wife
3. A little one who is potty training so well. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Knows how to potty train

Entry

Yesterday I mostly read and got caught up on everything in the morning, but by the time I had finished that it was time for a coffee chat with Josh Urbain. That was an enjoyable meeting, it ended up going a full hour instead of half an hour. Another fellow nerd at CE.  In the afternoon I started working on the repository configuration script, trying to get it to update the same repos that back stage looks at. It was going well I'd say.
After work I did my excersies. It was a bit exhausting, espectially after yesterday's run. But I did it. Now I am sore. This is honestly probably a good thing. No pain no gain right?
Played a little with Lucy till supper was ready. Did somethings out side, filled in a compost hole. Supper, praise band rehearsal, Final Fantasy 12. It was a good night.
### April 25

Things I'm thankful for


1. Productivity
2. A good nights sleep
3. A successful 3D print

Thing I love about Megan: 
Was willing to have some initmate time even late in the day un-planned.

Entry

Friday morning I managed to arrange a round of pictionary, and managed to win this time. Woohoo! Now I just need to work on my 7 Wonders skills. After playing the game there was T3 time for more UI education. After that I mostly worked on the repo configuration script. I learned a fair bit about github in the process. I was nearly done but didn't want to do the actual executing at 4:58 on friday. After work I ran like a good boy. I was already pretty tired from wednesday and thursday. But I managed to get most of the way through. I think I stopped for a walk once. I got home and we had supper and I took Lucy to the playground. We spent about 40ish minutes there before she was ready to head home. And so home we went. I worked on getting the Zigbee smart bulb working and was having no luck. Between that and Lucy being a pain in the neck that evening I went to bed in a pretty poor temper. 
The next morning I made muffins and we went Mead and the farmer's market and ran by runnings. I can't remember if it was in the morning before we left or after we got back, but I did end up getting the bulb to work by plugging the Zigbee hub into my desktop instead. This was enough to verify that the hardware all works, I'm dealing with only a software problem now. After my nap I set about building a trellis for our berry bushes. It ended up being quite tall at about 6.5'. It also cost more than I would have hoped at about 160$. 140$ of that was just the fence posts. Dang wood is expensive. I tried using stakes to hold the posts up right and tension the wires. but the 8" stakes were no match for the amount of force the wirse under tension would produce. So I gave up on that as it also seemed kinda unnecessary really. So what if the wirse sag a bit? I managed to wound my thumb ding the fence post holes. good job me.
After that we had supper, I showered, and then I found Megan lying on our new camp mat. I convinced her that we could still make love today despite Lucy having not napped. She agreed. Got Lucy settled and came back up. I chained her to the bed and tied her arms leaving her fully exposed spread like a star fish. It was my first use of the wartenburg wheel that I had been printing all day. It worked rather well but was sticking a bit and actually caused a scratch. Our first drawing of blood! I'm going to tweak it a bit and try again some other time. But the thing that went well this time was the little bells on her nipples. Whenever these jingled I would whip her. That made for a more fun game for all. It provided direction for my whipping and made something that she had to focus on not doing. A predicament. 
Sunday came. The Sunday of City Sweep. It was a busy day! First, I left in the morning to go to rehearsal. Returned to pick up Megan and Lucy. Then we had two services. Then it was city sweep, then we waited around till the bouncy castle was setup. I bounced in the castle with Lucy for about an hour. Managed to injury myself and a couple of the children. I spent a bit of time cuddling various children till they felt better. Then supper, then home at last. I finished of my audio book playing Valheim, then Megan and I played FFXII till bed time. We were exhausted. 
### April 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A productive night last night
2. A little girl who is potty training really fast
3. 3D printer to the rescue

Thing I love about Megan: 
Hot

Entry

ugh. I feel off right now. Like I failed something. Two things come to mind, an issue with uninstall codes that I missed and accidentally turning on "require checks" on a repo that it wasn't supposed to be turned on for. Ugh.
Yesterday I did a few more tweaks on uninstall codes and attempted to make archiving automatic. It sounds like everyone is in agreement though that auto archiving is a bad thing. *shrug* so I'll put up something that informs appropriate parties that a repo is ripe to be archived.
After work I did my exercise and then we made supper. It was a productive evening even if not much of what I wanted to be productive on was done. I put up 3 new smoke alarms which means we now have an alarm in each bed room, one in the family room, and one in our entry hall, this last one is an ionizing type so now we have all 3 types of smoke alarms (and the Ionizing type is less likely to give false alarms from cooking). I finally got Lucy's picture strip up, a piece of foam tape backed metal that she can magnet pictures to. Nice. Finally I put up her hat hooks as well. This was an interesting endevour. The hooks came with tiny screws that were certainly insufficent for drywall. I was going to use differen screws for which I had dry wall anchors but then I realized: I could print dry wall anchors! And so I did. I printed out 8 dry wall anchors and used them with the screws the hooks came with. Awesome!
### April 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Making it to my 32nd birthday
2. A new Sawzall
3. Plants going in the ground

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me very much. 

Entry

Forgot yesterday, woops. Tuesday at work I mostly made a video for review of the cycle. After work I got Zigbee2MQTT working on Midgard and now we have a sofa lamp controlled by home assistant! I also got the hose valve into home assistant. More things coming in everyday! I also finished clearing Megan's desk. Monday I installed smoke alarms and 3D printed dry wall anchors, Tuesday I glued. 3 different types of glue depending on the job. And I used my soldering iron to plastic weld Lucy's blue bears cup back together. Lastly I stappled a little box back together. Productive evening.
Yesterday was my brithday. Despite dropping hints, only Alan noticed. After working on a few things in the morning it was time for the 2022c2 review. Megan had slept in a little late so I opted to work through lunch and leave early. I played Valheim through the meeting, though it was a kinda interesting meeting and I paused the game several times. In game I stuck to simple tasks, in this case exploring. Trying to get the full lay of my island. After the meeting I watched some machine learning videos and Mark and I got the Uninstall code PR finally merged. Now that's a great birthday present.
I got done with work at 4 and we went to runnings to buy plants. We got basil, tomatoes, cilantro, parsley, and some flowers. I planted most of them, except for 4 of the basil plants. We are going to plant those in the area just east of the strawberry bed and I ran out of time to do all the work. I got a Sawzall for my birthday from Jeff, Cyndi, and Amanda. It came in use right away as a saw to cut some kity litter tubs into inground planters for the remaining basil plants. I will hopefully finish that project tonight. Megan and Lucy each picked out some flowers. I discussed locations with Megan to plant hers and Lucy told me where she wanted hers planted. I took her request and nudged it into a straight line. They aren't evenly spaced though so it still has some childish whimsy. 
After all that it was time for games with Ben. Valheim of course. I had marked a Crypt on the map at the end of our time last week. We went to it fairly straight away. It was an utter dead end. I was so disappointed. I felt cheated. We went our separate ways and proceeded to do other things. I went in search of another Crypt. I did find it and to my great delight I found scrap iron in this one. I didn't feel like fighting the Draugrs in the crypto so I took my gains and fled. I had want I wanted: Enough iron to make a stone cutter. To my great delight I actually had more iron than I needed and at the end of the evening donated the extra iron necessary to build a stone cutter to my personal game. 
After I got back with the iron I set about building a new work shop and kitchen. I used a fair bit of stone laying the foundation and such. It was nice to be able to build in such durable material at last. I got the foundation complete at the end of the game and started working on the walls. Then it was well past bed time. So we called it a night.
### May 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A comfortable new sleeping mat
2. Rain
3. Automations

Thing I love about Megan: 
Pushes me out of my comfort zone some times with camping. 

Entry

Thursday was mostly clean up. Trying to get through the little bits that kept me from closing the issues I had taken on myself. After work I started digging holes for the remaining basil plants to be planted into. Ran out of time before supper, but that was ok. Went to praise team rehearsal, which went very quickly and smoothly. Megan and Lucy did the grocery run while I was at rehearsal. Because rehearsal went so smoothly I was done before them. I sat outside and read while I waited for Megan to come pick me up. Got home and played video games for the remained of the evening.
After video games I went upstairs and installed our new RGB Zigbee lights into our night stands. They worked like a charm, but I'm going to need to find a method of turning the lamps on and off that is easier that opening our phones. I plan on using a 433mhz remote to achieve this. I should probably make that a priority now then. 
Friday morning I got up and made breakfast and then installed the zigbee lightswitch in the mainfloor bathroom. That allowed me to check one more item off of my automations list for this quarter in April. I'm actually making progress on that list, it's nice. After that we packed up and went camping.
It was a bit of a rough camping weekend. It mostly sits in my memory as bunkering down from rain, wind, and cold, watching Lucy at the park, and taking a walk once. Not entirely true, we took two walks. Hopefully our later camping trips will be a little less adventurous. Lucy met a boy named "Dexter" at the play ground and we obviously drew connections between her and Dex and Bluey and Juan Luc. 
Sunday we got home. Played Valheim. I stole some Iron from my and Ben's world so I could build with stone in my personal world. I proceeded to spend the entirity of the 2ish hours I had to play building a Bridge. A bridge, ti turns out, that is not quite tall enough to sail under. I may reconsider my design. The bridge is all stairs to try to get it high enough and it's still not high enough. I'm going to have to think about this. 
After Valheim I made pizza and we watched E.T. It was a good movie. It was one of those experiences where everything since it has been copying/inspired by E.T. so it felt a bit tropical, but it defined the tropes. 
### May 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Skill as a programmer
2. Days warm enough to wear shorts
3. Fun challenges at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is supportive of me.

Entry

I spent most of the day yesterday trying to figure out what is going on with the keys.json. No luck yet.
After work I lifted weights, Lucy was a bit annoying as usual. Then we had supper and I worked on budget automation stuff. I wanted to get prepopulation of cost centers working. I've got initial steps in that direction working by the end of the evening but it's not proving to be to useful yet because the mechanism for correlation isn't very strong. I'll need to find a way to use a GUID instead of the product name, which can change quite easily, to get a more robust linking. Also I just remembered that I only uploaded one month's worth of reciepts for correlation.
After I finished that I read to Lucy for a little while. I then spent about 5 minutes trying to get 433mhz radio receiver working with my Arduino. Unsurprisingly I didn't accomplish much in that time. But I think getting 433mhz up and running next is the best choice. Then the smart lights will be much more useful. Right now the smart lights are typically shut off manually and are thus dumb lights.
### May 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Funds to do home automation tasks
2. Paper Towels
3. Good Startrek

Thing I love about Megan: 
Patience when dealing with Lucy's multiple failures yesterday

Entry

Yesterday was still a bit of catch up. I got through the machine learning T3 Time and closed out some tickets. In the afternoon was the All staff meeting so I played Valheim as usual. I got seiged twice during that session which was less than pleasing. It delayed some of my efforts. I re-arranged my storage shed to now be my storage shed and workshop. I started work on a new outdoor workshop for the smelters and kilns but ran out of time. Perhaps that's where my cart can also live. We'll see next time I have t he opportunity to play.
After work I ran. I got exhausted earlier than normal but still managed roughly the same time. So I'm guessing I pushed myself harder on the front than previously. After that I sat out side with Lucy and read while Megan finished dinner. The cat wandered off. Little twerp. I found him around back and when I started shoing him back to the front yard he tried to run into our neighboor's yard. I grabbed him by the tail and pulled him back and threw him inside. Naughty little twerp. I wish the dogs had been out at that time. 
After supper I took Lucy to the playground. We played there for an hour. Came home and I worked on getting a 433mhz receiver up and running. I got one working with my arduino and then shifted to doing it with a NodeMCU. However all my nodes appearently are broken. So I had to order some more. Because these are all going straight into home automation tasks I didn't have to pay for them from my personal budget. Huzzah! I'll work on other tasks for now.
The biggest annoyance yesterday was Lucy. She managed to pee on the floor at least 4 times and poop in her pants. It's like she wasn't trying any more. So today she has no pants or underpants again until we get her back into doing her business on the potty. 
Started watching season 2 of Startrek Picard yesterday. It's off to a pretty good start.
### May 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain
2. Warm weather
3. Completed budget

Sexy

Yesterday we started the day with a game of "Code Names" between team Delta and team Next. They narrowly eeked out a victory. It was an amusing game. After that I spent the rest of the day attempting tests in Client API and then attending the R&D workshop. 
After work I set about working on the budget. I got all the receipts entered, most of them before supper. After supper I continued work on the budget and managed to do the entire thing by my self! Megan audited it later to be sure. This was the first time in a long time, if not ever, that one of us accomplished the entire budget on our own. I've got to get my budget automations a little more stable to get to the point where Megan can do all of it on her own at some point in the future.
I finished the budget just a few minutes before game time with Ben. It didn't load at first so I had to reboot. I finished most of the work on our new workshop last night. Got all the stone work complete and put a roof on it and got it functional as a workshop, kitchen, and store house. 36 chest in total. I am really pleased with how the whole project turned out. There is still some finishing work to be done on it.
While Ben and I were playing Megan decided to run get some icecream, what turned out to be an illfated endevour. She ended up spending 45m to accomplish this because the drive through at McDonalds was very conjested. So once again she didn't get to take a shower last night.
This morning I woke while having a dream about having an affair, some how involving wearing shoes in the shower :shrug:, but it nawed at me all day. I managed to hold it together though until bed time, at which point Megan was eager to have some intimite time as well. 
I decided I want to try going without A2U. I think my focus on honest over purity has done great and I don't think A2U is necessary any more. Also, it was proving easy to circumvent so I'm already heavily reliant on my integrity anyway. I've cancelled it and it will cease opperation at the end of this month.
#May 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun Videogames to play together
2. Clever ideas, even if they don't pan out.
3. Forgiveness

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys stories

Entry

Mostly just worked on client API testing yesterday. Got throughly side tracked for a while though when I tried to change up how the phone in the kitchen operates the undercabinet lights. I tried to get it to use home assistant intead of sending an HTTP request. This didn't end up working to my great dismay. The real problem though was the temptation to look at some porn while I had the device. I didn't look at porn, but I did read some descriptions on a naughty website. So I have marked that as a "Gave In", which is only the 4th such instance this year. Over all I'm doing quite well and it has been almost 4 months since an instance of failure that involved imagry. So I'm doing pretty well on the porn front.
After work I did my weight lifting. Then I tried to improve the homeassistant controls of the TV. Turns out the existing integration can do volume but I'm having trouble exposing that functionality to a dashboard. Not much luck there, I may have to seek assistance. We had supper and then went to praise band rehearsal. They were not very focused last night, but that was ok since I didn't quite finish my chapter of "Case for Christ" during rehearsal anyway. After rehearsal was FFXII time. The game is just enjoyable enough to keep us going. And boy is it pretty.
### May 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hansons
2. Beautiful weather
3. Skill to just make a mud kitchen

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys video games

Entry

Friday was a pretty good day at work. I managed to make a decent ways into testing ClientAPi. I need to figure out how to do mocks on my own now though.
After work I tried to accomplish some work on the distributed nodes project but I was having a lot of challenges getting the code to upload to my nodes and it was getting annoying. Also Lucy was being annoying and that was making it difficult to accomplish anything. So I felt really unaccomplished by the end of the evening.
Saturday I made breakfast and then set about the yard work. First mowing of the year. A lot of sticks to be picked up and pine needles to be racked. Then I spent the majority of the day working on a mud kitchen for Lucy. The primary objective here was actually to give me an excuse to practice plumbing. Unfortunately I didn't get to that part of the work. Hopefully I'll be able to start working on it tonight. It was a productive day. 
I played a little of Valheim that evening finishing the build of my new forge and kiln shelter. 
Sunday came. Church went well. After church I emptied the dish washer to be able to say I did some dishes. We were going to Hansons in the evening for supper. After the dishes I played Valheim for quite a while. I got my base all walled and feel fairly well defended now. I then managed to defeat the Elder! It actually wasn't to hard since I had spent a lot of time preparing and had really nice armor and weapons for this point. I then went to the swamp. With a poison resistance potion it really isn't that hard to traverse the swamp. I found a Sunken crypt and this one was a jack pot in comparison to the crap Ben and I found for our first crypt. I think I've managed to extract about 137 iron from it. What a score. Now I'm trying to get it all home.
Had a great time with the Hansons. I chatted with Derek about farming, guns, games, welding, and all sorts of things. It was a good evening. I hope we can get together sooner than several months.
### May 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Natural ability to just pickup skills.
2. Great prices at Bob's
3. Fun games

Thing I love about Megan: 
Suggested Icecream lastnight

Entry

Yesterday I worked on testing. I finished proving out the client api tests and progressed on to trying to do billing tests. I'm encountering a number of problems with the biling one, but overall am making progress. 
After work I did my exercise, we had supper, and then we walked to go pickup Urbosa who had been taken to the shop for a serpentine belt replacement. ~135$. Bob's is so cheap. I feel almost bad, like I'm cheating them out of money some times. After we got back I set about working on Lucy's Mud Kitchen again and attempted to do the plumbing. It went rather well honestly. I haven't been able to presurize the line yet, as I unfortunately bought the wrong size hose adapter. But the joins look good and I only burnt myself once. I'll get the missing piece tonight and try to finish it. If that goes well I'll start drawing up plans to do our shower fixture replacement. Only like 2 years after having bought the fixtures. It will be nice to have a lower faucet that redirects to teh shower properly.
I didn't get everything done in time to go to Ace to get the replacement part. So I went in and played some Valheim. I spent a while running back and forth between the swamp and my boat transporting all my iron scrap to my ship's hold. 139 Iron I think is what I left there with. Quite the haul. I was terrified that a sea serpent would show up out of no where and destroy my boat and make me loose all my iron scrap. I got out of the swamp just a little ways to my swamp portal and then ported home and spent the night. I came back and sailed home during the day to reduce my chances of getting murdered by a serpent. It was a bit harrowing having so much wealth in my ship at once, but I got home, all is well.
### May 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. At least something good from the doctor's meeting
2. Bricks for a bon fire pit
3. Flexible work hours

Thing I love about Megan: 
Will hopefully bear more children some day.

Entry

Yesterday was slower than I hoped. I fixed an issue with the client API that Mark had found, but we couldn't deploy due to an outage. So I moved on to testing billing and it is a slow sloug through the details of the billing api to get all the mocks constructed correctly. 
But, at 2:30 we left for Sioux Falls to meet with a Doctor there. This was a pre-conception appointment where the doctor talked a bit about options. They basically boiled down to a vagina progesteron supository and potentially some imunosupressors for possible immune response from Megan's body against the featus. She had her blood drawn for the latter and we'll know in about a month-month and a half. It was at least a little encouraging but nothing really sparked confidence. 
We went to Menards to see if they had Thermotech windows we could look at. No dice. We looked at bathroom vanities and have some ideas on how we'll remodel our main floor bathroom. I don't know when we'll be pursuing that just yet. We picked up a bunch of pavers, actually retaining wall bricks, to build a stone bonefire pit. This will be a great deal more robust than the cheap metal one we had. It will take me a fair bit of work to construct it properly though. I'm aiming for no mortor but I've got to do the work necessary to level a circle, incontrast to the square I currently have, for the pit. 
Did some reading in my microservices book. Falling behind on my reading this quarter. I'm kinda ok with that because it is the result of me prioritorizing other things.
### May 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Successful plumbing
2. A decent night's sleep
3. Progress at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Tries new things

Entry

Yesterday I made slow progress on the billing testing, but I did make progress. It wore my brain down trying to keep track of all the details. I managed to get something to work, before the end of the day.
After work I went off to the hardware store to try and get the remaining pieces I needed to get the mud kitchen project complete. No dice on some of them. I still have no latice and no wheels. The wheels I'm probably going to need to get off of amazon as I couldn't find any side mounted wheels at ace or runnings. I suppose I could still check tractor supply. I did, after some effort, find the pieces I need in order to addapt the hose to the 1/2" copper pipe used in the mud kitchen. I charged the line and all 5 solder joints held! I'm feeling pretty good about this now. I think I'll be able to handle replacing the shower fixtures just fine. 
After the mud kitchen I chisled the blocks we puchased for the bonfire pit until they were flat on the bottom so they would lie down neatly. The pit is now much more stable, but I still plan on replacing the existing blocks with gravel and making it circular not square. I'll probably do that this weekend.
Then we had supper. After Supper Ben and I played Valheim. A pretty quiet evening. We did a little more running around the swamp to get some chains and iron. A fairly successful trip. I was pretty disapponted in the hull from the crypt we explored though. However we did find another one, We'll return for that one next week. Then we did some puttering around our little compound. The workshop is done. Stone chimney, cross bars in the windows, iron cooking station, storage filled. Etc. It's all set! Oh, and I added on the forge and kiln area at the end of the evening.
I don't remember when Lucy climbed into our bed last night. But at about 5 this morning I put her back in her bed. We were anticipating storms over night, but none came. I got a decent nights sleep all things considered. 
### May 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice storm yesterday afternoon and evening
2. The logs gone from our front yard
3. Nice cool night air

Thing I love about Megan: 
Invited Lucy to come sleep with her last night.

Entry

Yesterday I got a little work done on administrivia. Atteneded the R&D attack vector meeting and wasn't terribly inspired. Part of that may be that the topic of primary discussion was iOS stuff and I don't know much about iOS stuff. I also worked for a while to figure out what exactly I am doing for tests in billing. I've got some questions for Alex that I'll pose to him here in bit. It was an okay day in terms of productivity. Towards the end of the day the productivity dropped off due to the excitement of the thunder storm. Temperature droped from 91 to 67 in 20 minutes, it was glorious.
After work I commented how I wasn't going to run because of the rain, then I realized I don't run on thursdays anyway, and went down stairs to do my weight lifting. I'm starting to get to the point where I'm actually being consistent and pushing myself to the point of exertion. I've locked myself in a bit with how I've designed things so far, everything is 3 sets of 10 reps, but I can improve on that for next quarter. 
After that we had supper, went for a walk enjoying the rolling thunder, and then were about to start playing games when the second round of storms hit. Throughly distracted again by the rain and light hail. Lucy got excited looking around on the ground for the hail once the storm had mostly subsidded. It was cute. I held her and we walked out into the drive way a bit where we could see lightening strikes ever couple of seconds in the distance. It was pretty cool. Then we finally got back in to play video games, FFXII, for a while. 
As we were getting ready for bed I made a couple automations. Now our bedside lamps turn on to full brightness when we turn them on in the evening. This helps me do my bullet journalling. Then they dim down to 39% at 10 when the stairs and entry hall turn off. I've thought about having them shut off when I plug in my tablet to charge, that's a possibility, we'll see. It was kinda neat seeing some of tha automations come into being.
### May 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Successful plumbing
2. Lucy Sleeping most of the night in her bed
3. A healthy church

Thing I love about Megan: 
Trusts me

Entry

Friday work went well, I made some progress on billing testing but I'm still wrapping my head around some of the javascript/typescript constructs, this is slowing me a bit. 
After work it was Lulu time evening, since I didn't do Lulu time on Tuesday. So I took her to the park and we played there for almost an hour. After that I just read. Trying to keep moving on my microservices book. 
Saturday morning came and I made blueberry scones. They were ok. But saturday was the big day for the shower repairs at last. After waiting since December 2020, a year and a half, I fixed the shower. It took me most of the day. I drained, or so I thought, the pipes to the shower upstairs, then I tried to unsolder one of the joints. to my great surprise it wasn't coming unsoldered. So I cut it. I went to unsolder the joint just down from it and realized why the other on wasn't coming undone, appearently the cold water valve leaks very slowly and that pipe had filled back up. What was bubbling and steaming out of the pipe for a little bit while I heated the joint and then the steam stopped, the solder melted, the joint came off just fine. I repeated on the other side. After a fair bit of work I test fitted all the pipes and got ready to solder them. 7 joints all at once. They all held perfectly. I've yet to actually have a join fail on me so I'm feeling pretty confident at this point. 
Anyway, the water wasn't working quite right at first though. To my great annoyance. I still don't know exactly what was wrong but I was getting no hot water pressure. I fiddled and fiddled and then suddenly it worked. :shrug: at least it works. Then I had a challenge getting the faucet on to the lower pipe without it leaking. I cross threaded the connector at one point and nearly tore my pipe apart trying to get it off. I was getting frustrated. But I eventually figured out what they intended me to do and got everything attached. I'd like to replace that pipe as a final step before I call it done since I did so much damage to it. I feel like it's prone to break from the damage soon as a result. But with that done, it was complete! The shower faucet and head are replaced! Quite the undertaking, done.
After that I scattered grass seed where the logs and been and flower seeds where the tree stump had been. Hopefully we'll have the front yard fully recovered by the end of this summer. Supper, I washed the car, and I took a shower in our new shower! It was quite nice. I liked the new shower head.
Sunday was annual meeting day. It was a good annual meeting, though I forgot to drive home and pickup Megan and Lucy before the first service. 10 minutes before the service I asked Tyler to cover me and I drove home. Woops. Our church is rather healthy all things considered. I hope we can continue to be benefits to our church and not drains. And I hope our church can continue to be active in our community.
After church we had thought about going and joining friends in the park for ultimate, but it was 2:40 at that point and I wanted to go home and change out of church clothes. So we decided to skip it. Hopefully next week.
Played Valheim and got frustrated because a one star elite draugr spwaned with a cloud of friends and I died probably 4 times trying to clear out the issue. I finally did as it was time to go make supper. I had found 5 crypts so I was a little sad I didn't get to do any dungeon crawling. I did get to play a little more after the movie, but was un-able to complete the crypt I was splunking. Which is good in a way because the problem was caused by having to much to explore. I'm going to have to decide if I want to risk bringing my long boat to the swamp or put forth the effort to sail my karve multiple times to transport all the iron I'm going to extract from these crypts. Probably the latter for practical reasons, I want to upgrade my weapons and armor as I go rather than all at once at the end. 
We watched "Harriot" a biography of Harriot Tubeman last night for our movie. I'd like to know more about the slavry era I am discovering. Megan appearently has read lots and lots, it was appearently her bread and butter when she was 7. 
We watched the Lunar eclipse happen last night. We didn't get to see any of shadow's retreat as the moon was behind the trees by then, but it was fun watching the moon disappear. 
### May 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A quite evening to read
2. Cool nights to sleep
3. Fun videos to watch

Thing I love about Megan: 
Only really denies me sex for practical reasons.

Entry

Yesterday at work I finished the billing mock testing branch, with some assistance from Alex. I tried helping with some MA19 issues and had some time to think about state testing. I'm going to need to discuss this, potentially with Alan, today to know exactly what we should do.
After work I did my exercise and then went outside and picked up sticks while Megan made supper. There were a lot of sticks because of the vigerous storm we had over the weekend. It took me a while, but it should leave me in a good condition to mow the lawn today or tomorrow. After supper I was thinking maybe I'd work on the bonfire pit, but Megan promised Lucy that she'd take her to the play ground. I ceased the opportunity to accomplish quite things at home. I ticked off a few tasks that had queued up (run amazon scrappers, order us mobile sim, fix mounting drives on Megan's computer), and then I sat and read. I got about half way through a chapter of building micro services. These late chapters are all fairly large and so I'm having a hard time getting through them. Then it was bed time.
Overnight I had an interesting dream about exploring the moon, and a rather suburban america style neighboorhood that was being built there. I was exploring with an attractive russian cosmonaught and I recall flirting pretty hard, and at one point bluntly asking if she wanted to make out, and I got denied on all fronts. lol. Couldn't get a women in my dreams appearently.
### May 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Immune system
2. Cinnamon whiskey
3. A guest bed

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cares for me and Lucy

Entry

Yesterday was a bit slow. I mostly did some thinking. And I was coming down with a cold so I was struggling to fight that off. 
After work I collapsed in the arm chair, and then I read, or tried to at least, until it was time to go to the missions team meeting. Meeting went well, but I had wished I had brought more cough drops, my throat was hurting by the time we finished. Sounds like we are going to a driving range for a team bonding time. SHould be fun.
After that we came home and went straight to bed. Lucy was not going down, and I knew I'd sleep better in the other room so that's what we did. I took an extra blanket and beneath the to I delightfully overheated and my fever broke. I managed to stay down most of the rest of the night, surprisingly I didn't end up taking any more cough drops to ease my throat. 
### May 19

Things I'm thankful for


1. Whiskey
2. A good nights sleep
3. Fun games with Ben

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cares for me when I'm sick

Entry

I was not quite as healed as I thought yesterday. After my morning meeting I conked out for a while and read my microservices book. Once I finally was able to get myself to focus I started working on testing. Megan took Lucy to the Train Museum and Nature Center together with Jessica, Clark, Sabrina, Arthie, and Penelope. So I was on my own for lunch. I decided to play Valheim over my lunch break. Most notable part of this is an abomination spawned on my swamp camp. This was quite inconvenient. After lunch I worked on tests again. I'm trying to get the initial suite to be generated based off of what Mark has done in postman. It's coming along, but there are a lot of tests. Mark did quite a bit of work.
After work I mowed the lawn. I was glad for the bit of exercise but I was really worn out by the end of it. I sat for a bit, then we had supper, then I showered so I wouldn't be sleeping with green feet. At this point I was pretty exhausted so I sat and played Valheim for the rest of the evening. Ben logged in while I was playing and I showed him my world quickly. It turns out there is not a lot to show off in this game so the show and tell didn't last long. Then he briefly showed me his world. He's not spent a lot of time in architectural flourish, but had seemed to accomplish the things that mattered. 
Then we went to our world. I spent the evening building us a new home. It came out quite nice, and unlike the workshop I was able to complete it all in one evening. Not having to run gather resources helped with that. And having fewer requirements than the workshop for things like chimneys. But right as it was about time to call it an evening, wouldn't you know it but trolls attack. *eye roll* they some how manage to know exactly when we are wanting to get off. 
After play games it was bed time. I felt like a furnace all over. I felt the kind of tired one feels after a long day of hiking or something, where the sound of relaxing or sleeping just sounds soooooooo good. And sleep I did. It went rather well, still not great though. I had a fever break again last night, so clearly not quite out of the woods, but if how I feel right now is any indicator, things are going well. I hope to be fine by the weekend.
### May 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Winning appriciation from friends.
2. A fun code generation challenge
3. Tasty food from our garden (last year's garden infact)

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is flexible.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly worked on fine tuning my code generator. Alan pointed out a way I could reduce the number of lines of code, so I went about doing such. I didn't quite finish it by the end of the day, but I made significant strides.
After work I was thinking I would take Lucy to the playground for Lulu time, but Megan went to do the grocery shopping so I decided I would do it after supper. But that plan changed too. Derek need some one to cover for him on sound for rehearsal and I said I could do it. I'm glad for the opportunity to earn apprication from friends like this. It helps build our friendship, maybe I'll be able to consider him a close friend and vice versa one of these days. 
Went to rehearsal, read microservices. Came home and we played FFXII. I skipped the candy and had some cinnamon whiskey as I still had a sore throat. 
Lucy was an a pill when it was time to clean for the robot. I told her to pick up her jewelry or I'd take them away, she snatched a neckless and then told me to take them away. grr. we tried to get her to do a number of things, none of which she did, so finally we put her in time out. She didn't try to get out of the bathroom, she just sat in there and screemed. We finished cleaning and I took her upstairs. Again, she wasn't listening. Megan told her to put something on her butt if she wanted to play in our pillows. She refused and refused to listen so I took the pillows away. After some bluey I managed to get her all ready for bed. It was about time for bed and she was still refusing to do anything we asked of her, in this case it was putting a laundry basket she brought to the middle of the room back. So Megan put her in time out again, this time in her room. She screemed again but when Megan went in to get her she refused to come, she had tucked herself into her bed. So we shruged and went on. We started watching our show. We finished. We wanted to make love that night but we didn't know when Lucy would come to bed. About 2-3 minutes after we laid down she came into our room and said she was ready. I asked her to put the laundry basket away and she collapsed to the floor. I helped her, she collapsed to the floor after it was done again. Then she went to Megan for milk. Had both milks, was still wide awake, went to her bed and watched dancing music, watched little worship company. Then she decided she wanted to come to the big bed. She squired and squired and would nto let me sleep, as she decided she wanted to sleep on papa's side of the bed. Finally I had enough. at about 1:30 in the morning I went to the guest bed. I don't know how the rest of the night went for them, but it took me a little while to get comfortable and conk out. After that the night wasn't so bed. Still, it was annoying all that we had to go through to get there.
### May 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Healing
2. Tulip Festival
3. My mom's histories of me.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is patient

Entry

Friday morning went to T3 time for neural networks. I'm starting to get some idea of what these are useful for and whether or not they would work for my application of location tracking via computer vision. After that I mostly hammered on my code generation for the Client API testing. I got it done I believe and ready for PQA.
After work we loaded up and head to Orange City for Tulip Festival. When I got there I saw that Brady and Kennan's flowers were still going for Mom's month of flowers. I don't think she's full realized it yet, probably won't until after she gets Ethan's flowers. I hope she'll have liked the idea. Clearly we could have even spaced it out further and it could have been pretty good.
We wandered down to the fair grounds, had supper, I had a "Tomahawk pork chop" for an eye watering 10$. but it was a fun experience. We took Lucy on a carosel, I failed at the ticket payment and handed the conductor all 6 tickets instead of just 3. woops. twice now we've failed on that front. Last time Megan asked the attendant if she had to pay to ride with Lucy and the attendant gave a kind of "well, since you asked, yes, but if you hadn't asked I would have just let you." So Megan and I are now tied for wasting tickets. 
We enjoyed our evening and the next day watching the parade and such. Lucy was sick over night so we didn't have a terribly good night's sleep. Debbie Reaves and her husband came to the festival and used my Mom's extra parking spot. We chatted for a while about various musical things. Megan quitely and patiently sat there with not much to contribute. Eventually we got to our Lunch and they left for the parade. We talked again later in the day before they left for the evening. A little while later we had supper and headed home our selves.
We got to the farm's open grounds event with about 25min to spare. The part didn't wrap promptly at 7, so we were there a bit later, till about 7:20. We got home, unpacked, and settled back in, bathed, etc. I got my new SIM from US Mobile to experiment with them as a cellular provider. So far so good. The real test is going to be when we drive up to Pierre SD and what the signal is like all the way there and back. 
Sunday came and we went to church. Lucy still had the sniffles so she came home with me after the first service. Last separate services of the year. Next Sunday we'll be down to a single service. I played Valheim any time I had down time on sunday. I bucked up the courage to build my new base in the plains. I had some issues with harassment from Fulings, Growths, Deathsquittos, and a local herd of Lox. Once I get my walls fully built this will be less of an issue. I'm almost there. I plan on also having 4 towers, one in each corner, that I'll be able to use to defend my base from. Over all it was an evening mostly of building and I was pleased with how far I managed to get. I even pillaged a Crypt to get the iron I needed for the stone cutter and sailed the iron there. As well as 15 Sutling cores to run the furnaces.
Amanda came over just before I returned to pickup Megan from church, that was convenient. Lucy and Amanda played for a while, and Amanda and Megan chatted. I played Valheim. Then Amanda left and Lucy napped until 4:15 when I went and woke her up. I made supper and got everything cleaned up so I played some more games before returning to the Pizza. We watched "Forest Gump" last night. I've been wanting to see it for a long time because it's such a well known film. It was quite a trip seeing such a young Tom Hanks. The movie came out in 94, and so I just am used to him being an old guy, but that was almost 30 years ago.
Played a little more Valheim before bed.
Lucy was annoying again last night. It was not a good nights sleep.
### May 24

Things I'm thankful for


1. Electronics projects coming together
2. A good nights sleep
3. Plants taking root

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cuddly

Entry

Yesterday was pretty productive. I Fixed some issues Justin saw in the mock testing for billing and I've wrapped my head around what needs to be done for the scenario testing for billing. Oh yea, it's all coming together now. 
After work I did my exercise and then I started working on the garage door controller for home assistant. Despite many interruptions for Lucy I managed to prove out the entire project. That last critical part of this was getting the node to respond to requests coming into it from MQTT. The protocol is so light and fast that my main problem ended up being the 1 second delay was causing the incoming message to be dropped. I removed the delay at 9:28 last night, saw a message come in, and called it an evening. I was pleased. I've got some reservations about whether I'll be able to fit this all onto the one bread board I have been plannig to use but my mind has been going all night and this morning with potential ways to accomplish this so I think I'll come up with something.
Not mentioned in the previous paragraph: I tried doing a C++ class at first but was having what I think were memory issues. I switched over to using structs instead as they are much lighter in memory than classes are. Once I made that switch the code ran pretty well.
After all the tinkering it was time for bed. Getting to bed went fairly well, Lucy wasn't exceptionally grump for a change. We got to bed and Lucy slept the entire night in her bed. She even slept through me showering. But between me getting dressed and me coming back up she did awake and make her way to the big bed. It was a good night as a result. Seems to have been a good night for her as well. 
### May 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lots of talents
2. Cool spring days
3. Sprouting grass

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty food

Entry

Yesterday's work was pretty focused. I worked entirely on finishing the scenario testing for billing. I will admit though that I got pretty distracted by my garage door project as well and was making edits to the code when ever my work project was compiling. *runs away* Just remembered I never commited my changes. Done. Back to journalling. 
After work I ran 2.1ish miles. I'd like to get up to 3.1m on tuesdays, working my way there but it doesn't look like it will happen before swimming season. Which should start next week I think?
We had supper and I tried to take Lucy to the park. To be fair, we got there, but the very gentle rain was just enough that it made the slides all wet and not usable. So we went home. It was a slow walk both there and back so that was nice. The teeth pulling part was getting her out the door in the first place, a process that took about 20 minutes. I did proceed to play with her for about half an hour after we got back home. 
I spent most of my evening then modeling a case for the garage door opener. I just pulled a case off of thingiverse for the remote sensors so that was easy. I started a test print of the case just this morning so we'll see how it comes out (I may run out of filament. woops!). Then it was time to clean for the robot, Lucy was again, a pain in the neck and peed on the floor. We are starting to wonder if it is some sort of revolt against cleaning for the robot. Friday we are going to sit her on the toilet before saying its time to clean for the robot. She also appears to not be bothered by time outs. Great. We are loosing that tool to. Troublesome child. 
Bed time went pretty well. Lucy didn't come to our bed till about 5 in the morning and settled down quickly and so we all got back to sleepy pretty well.
### May 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Agar.io
2. A clever mind
3. Zigbee

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes planning parties.

Entry

The start of the day it was game day at work. We postponed our fight with NEXT till both managers could be available. So we played Agar.io. It was hilarious and fun. Emily did really well and we ended up trying to protect her most of the time. We ended up playing till 9:15ish. After that I worked on some issues Justin saw in my billing PR and then in the afternoon I worked on Client API Client routes. There are only 5 that need to get tested, I got 3 of them done but then slowed down on the 4th as it had actual interactions with the database that needed to be mocked out. I slowed down also as I was getting nascious, I think from the nasal drainage as I enter the final stages of recovery. 
After work, no exercise, wednesday is nice in the ways some times. I mocked out a new bracket for holding the ultrasonic sensor for my garage door controller, I think I've got it right now. But I got distracted by another idea that had rapidly bubbled to the surface. I'm hoping to build a new bonfire ring. For that I'd like a tamper to settle the ground before I put the bricks on it, but I don't want to buy a tamper for 60$. I've imagined just putting a slab of wood on the end of one of the broom sticks I found in the neighbor's dumpster. But that wouldn't provide the weight a tamper needs to do its job properly. Then an idea rapidly came into focus. I'll 3D print a adapter. This adapter will have 4 screw holes to attach a slab of wood as the face plate and then a shaft that is identical to the one that is on my dumbells. I will be able to place weight plates onto it and they will provide the mass for doing the tamping. Using the screw on said shaft to hold the weights in place. Then inside this shaft will be another screw, this one designed to attach to the screw of a broom stick/paint roller. In doing so I will create my own tamper that will cost me only a few bucks. Nice. And when I'm done with said tamper it can be disassembled and stored much easier. So I started designing the screw for that but ran out of time before games with Ben. I did put the finishing touches on the sample this morning and print it. It worked great. I think I'll make it a little bigger though to try to get it to sit a little tighter. 
Valheim with Ben went great. We demolished our beach house, our second house that I built weeks ago when we moved to the shore away from the hilliness near the alter. I patched up the ground and built our new portal hut on the spot. We currently have 6 portals so it's second floor is completely un-used. But that does mean it should last us for a while. I didn't quite finisht the structure. I just need to put a cupola on the top and it will be done. Next week Ben and I will return to the swamp to get that second crypt I think. 
Bed time wasn't to aweful. Lucy just had a bunch of energy. But eventually she went down. Megan and I are overal not impressed with "Ancient Magus's bride". It just doesn't seem to be going anywhere and Megan said it's not her type of romance. The show was so highly rated I assumed it must be good, but so far it's just not been terribly interesting. We'll give it to the end of this season. 
### May 27

Things I'm thankful for


1. Well timed game nights (we accomplished a "chapter" so to speak in exactly the time we had)
2. A week off from church commitments
3. A 3D printer.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys video games with me.

Entry

Yesterday at work I had hoped to finish the client routes, but Drake's PQA dragged me down. He spotted all sorts of problems and I had to slowly slough through them all. I didn't end up getting to client routes until the end of the day. But I had some time to think about them so I was able to accomplish one before the days end. That was nice.
After work I did my weight lifting. I could feel my legs getting tired, good sign. But I managed to push through and fully complete all the exercises. 
After supper I started working on my tamper model. I got it all designed just before it was time to play video games. I've put it up on Thingiverse, today I am printing it, we'll see if it works. I looked up how much tampers usually weigh and it's only about 10 lbs. So I think I may have gone over kill on the screw. I may do some more fine tuning of the design. One part of that I think will be to go back to a low resolution screw. The smoothness is neat and all, but it makes it a pain to work with. 
After modeling it was game night. We got through another "chapter" so to speak of FFXII. But I think we need to do some grinding now. We will be traveling next week so I threw out the idea of grinding while we travel, Megan wasn't wild on the idea, but we'll see. 
I filled in the compost hole that we've had since fall. It seemed to just keep accepting more and more compost. After I stirred it this time it again seemed to have all the space in the world. Never the less I decided that enough was in there, so I filled it in and dug a new one. I tried transfering the grass from the new hole to the old one, but the new hole was under the pine trees and it didn't really have grass to speak of.
Lucy was wired last night. It was probably like 1 before she went down for real. We think maybe this was due to the candy she ate during video game night. That's annoying. 
### May 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 3 Day weekend
2. Projects coming together
3. Cool weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encouraged me to ask Tiahrts over.

Entry

Mostly pushed to finish the client route testing at friday. Finished at about 4:30 and decided to call it a day early since I wasn't likely to accomplish much on a new task in 30 minutes, and anyway, it was a holiday weekend.
Chatted with my mom who was visiting for a bit and then I took my evening run. We had supper, chatted some more, went for icecream, and chatted some more. it was a low key evening. 
Saturday morning I made danilion muffins. They weren't to bad. A fair bit of effort to extract all the pedals though. I had a single focus for the day, get the mud kitchen completed. I nearly succeeded. The only thing left to do is a latch for the "oven" door. After finishing that I changed focus and started working on the bon fire ring, enter my home made tamper.
Up until the moment I actually used the tamper, it looked great. It took about 3 strokes to break the tamper into as many parts. It snapped basically where I was expecting in both cases. It was a fun endevour but in the end a complete failure. Perhaps if I had the ability to make it out of metal instead of plastic it would have held together. But it didn't, oh well. I used my feet to stomp and tamp instead. The bottom layer of bricks were not flat when I finally got them in place though. This was disappointing. But I realized I could solve this issue. I grabbed a rubber mallet and my bubble level. I banged on each brick until it was level in both directions and the same height as it's neighbor. I did this all the way around until the bottom was entirely level. It worked great. Then I placed the two further levels on top of it and called it a bonfire ring. I started a fire to burn through our excess sticks and pine needles. It wasn't the greatest christening because pine needles are a bit annoying to burn. But over the following days the embers burned mostly to ash. (untill it rained) By the time I got the lawn mowed I was utterly wiped. So very exhausted. Played some Valheim.
Sunday morning I read Microservices. Megan woke before Lucy. I eventually went up and woke Lucy and we headed to church. It was nice getting done at church early, if a bit dissorienting. In the afternoon I played some Valheim (new base is coming together) and played some ultimate frisbee with the Vermillion friends. It was good. It's nice to have some gameified exercise. I need to work on my sprints. 
We watched Ghost busters in the evening.
It was a hot evening. We were all short tempered as a result. It was not a happy time getting ready for bed. We slept decently well once we all got there. Lucy is still doing her pouting in her bed for no appearent reason and it drives me mad. I'd much rather have some idea of what's wrong so we could actually fix it. 
### May 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A cool night for sleeping
2. Down to just one accountability program
3. A TV to keep Lucy occupied.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is mortal and gets annoyed with Lucy some times just like me.

Entry

Yesterday was the observed holiday for Memorial day. It was an okay day. I played Valheim in the morning. Then worked on the wiring for my garage door controller. The new wiring looks good, everything is coming together, but I got foiled by some bugs I have yet to fully pin down. 
Tiahrts came over after lunch and we played some games together, it was quite fun. 
In the evening Lucy was driving us nuts. Both myself and Megan. I got frustrated by my project and so eventually just plopped Lucy in front of the TV and myself in front of Valheim. 
### June 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A tent for Lucy to play in
2. Forgiveness
3. Sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
She is onboard with exploring our sexuality to bring us closer together.

Entry

Yesterday was not a good day on the lust front. Lets just get this all out of the way first thing. First, in the morning I more or less took an opportunity to reveal in the fact that A2U was no longer on my personal desktop. Some of this I took advantage of in a some what sensible way, I searched for things on Amazon and the like. But I also looked at some highly questionable, debatably pornographic material before work. It happened again later in the day when Megan took a walk. And then again in the evening while she was off getting somethings at Walmart. The last time of which I finally acknowledged it, I was looking at porn. So my first failure in over 3 months of managing to not look at porn. I must admit that this was not entirely un-expected and so I'm not beating myself up about it to much. Of course once A2U was gone there was going to be a release. I think moving forward it won't be as big of an issue, and I'll be harder on myself in those moments. 
Yesterday work wasn't the greatest either. Obviously I had some level of distraction from the above. But also I was just making slow progress on the mocks. I'm writing some documentation as I go, but that doesn't explain all of the slugishness. That I attribute more to having gotten confounded by some parts of the code. So I completed one test and started another. Hopefully I can accomplish more today.
After work we went to Meede lumber to look at a double hung Thermotech window. We are still not sold on which window we want to get. Thermotech is going to cost us about 400$ per window, Anderson 400 will cost 700$ per window. I will admit that the Anderson ones are nicer, but I just don't know if they are 300$ worth of nicer. As a result I'm leaning towards the Thermotech windows, but I get what Megan says when she notes that we'll be going from wood windows to all vynl windows. That is going to be quite the change in looks. I don't know. But we do need to decide here soon ish.
After that I played with Lucy in her tent, then we had supper, then I played with Lucy some more for my Lulu time this week. After that I worked on the garage door controller. Turns out my problem with the ultrasonic sensors always returning 58us for the range was a result of using 3.3v instead of 5v for their power. I thought I had to use 3.3v so that it could signal to the nodemcu, but turns out that isn't true. I switched over to vin from 3.3v and the sensors started behaving. I got the two sensors wired up and working and then I went to the garage, measured some wire runs and then started striping, crimping, and taping the wires to make the cables. I have a design in mind for doing this with RJ45 connectors and cat5 cable instead, but that design also uses PCBs and I'm not sure I want to go down that trail yet. So I'm sticking with the simplier wires for now. 
### June 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Housing upgrades starting to come together
2. Progress on my garage controller
3. Ability to resist.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans everything very well.

Entry

Yesterday's work wasn't amazing. I really hoped I'd accomplish a lot this week, but I've not had much luck. It turns out there was a lot more to mock out than I had hoped. I was hoping that would have been primarily done by the first round. So I'm making painfully slow work. I talked to Justin this morning, hopefully that will get me going.
After work I finished up Lucy's Mud kitchen. It is now ready for her when we return. 
Lucy was a bit of a turd yesterday because she didn't take a nap. After supper I chased her out side to try and play with her. She chased me around, we jumped up on the cherry stump and when she jumped off she scraped her foot, drew blood. We eventually would return to playing outside after I got her foot bandaged and she calmed down with some Bluey. About 7:30 though I said I was done and she was sad. But I wanted to do a little more on the garage door controller. That morning during standup I finished assembling the dupont connectors for the satelite ultrasonic sensors. I got a little further. I was finding that if I introduce some delay between samples the signal gets more reliable. I think this might have to do with not waiting long enough for the echos to clear out, or even properly return in the first place. But putting in delay causes incoming MQTT to get missed so I'm going to have to do a fair bit of redesigning to get it sorted. 
Played Valheim with Ben. We managed to get a load of Iron back to our base. Hopefully we can get a fair number of items created for us from it. But we spotted at least 2 more crypts in the same swamp for us to explore soon. 
### June 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good drive to and from Pierre
2. Amanda being done with her training
3. Camping with Megan's family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a wonderful family.

Entry

Thursday. It was a rough day. I ended up wasting my morning on a wild goose chase and then still didn't accomplish the mock test I was trying to do. I'm hoping that fresh eyes on it today will be able to get me going.
After work, at about 4, we headed out to Pierre. Amanda was graduating from Police Academy and we were going to go camping. We took longer getting there than we had hoped, but we got there with still enough light to setup camp.
Friday was a little slow off the blocks but we got to Amanda's graduation on time and bore witness. It was interesting to note that the invocation prayer was explicitly Christian, closing in Jesus name. Amanda graduated with an honor. All went well. Definately the most guns I've ever witnessed at a garduation as almost all the graduates were armed, there were like 100 something other officers there who were armed, and I think I saw some carries on other audiance members. We joked that if a shooter had decided to crash the graduation the head line would read something like "7 dead from shooting at police graduation, 1 shooter and 6 from friendly fire". 
After the graduation we went back tot he camp site. Napped and generally relaxed for the rest of the day. Sat around chatting and such.
Saturday we got out on a walk to Farm Island, which has had a cause way built out to it so it's not so much an island as a peninsula now. It was a nice walk, and getting rained on on the way back wasn't to bad. It was a little hot for me though because at that point I was wearing my coat to protect me from the rain and carrying a sleeping Lucy. I was getting wet as much from sweat as anything. 
We got back late in the afternoon and by the time we got going again it was time to strike camp. We decided to leave a day early since it was supposed to rain Sunday morning. We didn't get to tour the capital as a result. Sad, perhaps another time. We got home around 11. Ben rode with us this time and he managed to keep Lucy happy for tha majority of the ride. While she slept and watch bluey we let him play on the switch as a thank you.
Sunday was fairly productive. With the help of Ben, Josh, and Jeff we managed to get Lucy's playset levelled. We detached the attachments and lifted the core of it to the drive way where we attempted to straighten it. It helped but there is still a deffinate lean to it. The bigger help was leveling the bricks upon which the playground sat. I had purchased a length of plastic tube to create a water level. This worked fairly well but I purchased to little tubing. I had planned on taping one end to the fence so that it was stationary, but with it there we couldn't reach all the bricks. So instead I taped both ends to poles and drove one into the ground to act as our stationary point of reference. We then used the water level to get all the bricks at the same height. A string to get them in line with each other, a tape measure to get them spaced correctly, and lastly a bubble level to get them level. It might have been over kill but golly does it look good, and was relatively easy to do. 
Josh also climbed up into the big maple and broke the large branch that was up in the tree into smaller parts that could fall out. We had a bonfire to rid ourselves of the smaller bits. The larger chucnks we can hold on to for fire wood. 
Then we relaxed in the afternoon. Played some moving out. Played some stick fight. ate food. It was nice.
Over the weekend I was struggling with a sexual fantasy. We have thusly been regarding such as sort of ok as long as they were about Megan (this one was not) as a sort of relief. And spiritually I'm struggling with that. In short I'm wondering "Is it better to be consistently a little sinful, but avoiding big mistakes or better to strive for purity with occational big mistakes?" I don't know. I'm leaning towards the latter, to my great dismay, but it seems to be the only position consistent with God being first in my life. Thus far it's felt like "God, you can have all of me, except for that sexual sin over there." which feels like I'm putting that before God then. I'll have to think about this.
### June 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Progress at work at last
2. Warmish water at the pool
3. A chance to hear about our potential school board members.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is thoughful about things like the school board members.

Entry

Yesterday I finally got unstuck. I'm making progress now and only have one more method to mock out I think before I've got it working. Finally.
Left work a little early to take Lucy to her swim lessons. Monday and Wednesday I'll be doing lap swims while Megan takes her to her lesson on those days. Megan will then do water walking Tuesday and Thursday and I'll take Lucy to her lesson. So yesterday was my first day swimming. It wasn't to hard getting back into it. But I will be very happy to get a lap counter this year. Unfortunately that won't happen till next quarter. 
After lane swimming we came home, rinsed off, and made supper. I then started working on the budget. After a while Megan put on the School Board election forum and we got to hear the opinions of the potential candidates. Leaning towards Jacob and Jan for this election. 
### June 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My Job
2. A detailed budget
3. A forgiving wife

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a comfort to myself and Lucy

Entry

Yesterday I finally got that route testing working. Justin helped me with a tidbit of it, but then I got it finished all the way and got a PR up. It looks like Justin has already reviewed it and I may be able to push it to QA today. Only took me 5 days. (probably 4 days to do the one route).
After work we went to the pool for swim lessons. These are pretty low key for some one Lucy's age. It's mostly about getting her comfortable with the water at this point. We came home and rinsed off and had supper. After supper it was Lulu time for me, Lucy wanted to play hotels. I was feeling really tired and should have taken a nap. But I went and played with Lucy, as a result my mood was a little sour and at one point I asked her to help pull me up and I pulled her arm to hard and I think I sprained her wrist. She was holding it the rest of the evening and would break out into screams when ever we touched it or moved it, even through the night. She's still asleep right now. Hopefully she feels better this morning. I feel aweful as it is, I'd hate for my silly mistake to ruin her party today. 
Megan left me home alone most of the morning. I was getting really really tempted to go look at some porn. But, by the grace of God I contained myself. It has been the first major rebuttle since A2U has been taken off of Tellurium. But I did end up looking at some lewds later that day so I'm not perfect. But lord willing I will hopefully keep on resisting.
Finished the budget last night. It, unfortunately, took basically all evening to finish out. I'm trying to catch all the gotchas so that this process can be more stream lined. But it is still taking a while. Megan continues to find things that I missed.
Alan was let go/resigned/fired (I don't know, there's not a lot of detail available yet) this morning, effective immediately. I... I don't even know what to think. With no detail there is not much to process. Alan is gone now, that's all I know.  
### June 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy Healing 
2. A good evening with Ben
3. A strong team at work over all

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is helping Lucy to get over getting water on her face even if she's not tackling it her self.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't a great day at work. I did accomplish the security training, so that's good. But I got stuck on billing testing AGAIN. Gah! Hopefully I can finish it today.
And of course yesterday morning Alan resigned. We still don't know any details about what happened. A thought I did have though that was a little chilling to me was "I didn't see anything wrong." And to be a bit charitable to myself, I wasn't in the same circles as Alan so it would not be difficult for me to not see the problem as it could have happened where I wasn't seeing it. But I must concent that there was a problem as this was incited by employee reviews and management took it very seriously. There may be room to argue severity, but there is very little to argue existance. And the fact that I didn't see the problem is itself a problem. There is an issue here that was big enough to result in Alan's termination but I didn't even see it. Troubling. I clearly need to improve on my skills of observation.
After work we went to the pool. I commented to Megan on the way to the pool how I dread exercise some times. It's a little like eating vegitables. And like eating my veggies I hope I eventually come to at least no dread the activity even if I still amnot fond of it.
We got home, changed, and cleaned up from Lucy's party. It sounds like it was a pretty good party. I then mowed the lawn. I mowed the area where the logs had been for the first time since I seeded it. I think I'm going to buy some more seed this weekend and plant some more grass but it is good to see the grass recovering. I will be sooooo happy when they finally trench that cable in the back yard though. It's getting annoying. 
We had supper and I took a quick shower before playing Valheim with Ben. It was a pretty good evening. We are getting into the swing of things for iron production now. We got our iron tools and each have an iron helmet. We sailed a long boat through the middle island straights, proving it can be done. We ran a ground a fair bit though and Ben ended up dying from frost. I finished the voyage and Ben met me in the swamp. We set up a portal near a crypt and strip it, getting 74 iron, just shy of the 80 we need to get us the rest of our iron armor. Of course once we've got the armor we'll need still more to finish upgrading it. I think our next major activity after we finish gathering iron from the swamp will probably be putting some walls up around our base, we've been acosted a few times and it would be nice to have some walls. 
### June 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Starting to track with FFXII's story
2. A nice gentle rain
3. Progress on my garage door controller.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plays games with me.

Entry

Yesterday at work went a little better. I got stuck a little bit but with some guidance from Todd and Alex I got the tests running in github so I just need to do a live PQA with Todd and that PR should be ready for QA. Then I worke don Client API scenario testing round two. Got the branch mostly done, just needs some cleaning. 
After work it was raining so no swim lessons. We made supper first thing, and after such I read Lucy some books. I wanted to go work on my garage door controller immediately but I was feeling drowsy again and this time I decided to listen to my body. I took a 20m nap and then got to the controller. I made some progress last night. I shifted to a rolling average for the sensors and introduced time delays that should allow echos to clear out. The sensors are now providing stable results outside of the rolling average, and the rolling average cleans up the rest of the noise. I need to hone in some of the numbers a little bit, which will involve doing some measurements in the garage, but I think I'm getting very close now to deploying this. 
After that we played FFXII. Between getting our equipment sorted out and spells becoming available I actually feel like we are starting to have some agency in this game. And I feel like I've heard enough of the story to start to have some purchase on it. That's encouraging.
Lucy bright eyed and bushy tailed at bed time again last night. We are pretty convinced now that the sugar from her candy is what is doing it. We are positive at least twice she's been wide awake at bed time on thursdays after candy. So we are going to mix things up a bit next week. We are going to play games immediately after supper and try to get more time between bed time and candy. 
### June 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chainsaw for a period. (selling it now)
2. A chance to play games with Skylar
3. Some sports to get some exercise in that's fun

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is motivated to get out and walk.

Entry

Friday was a pretty quiet day at work since we were down both Drake and Justin, at least after our morning meetings. We had a meeting with Ray about Alan, which wasn't terribly informative. I think the most informative part was detail that we won't be receiving any further information from CE about what happened. If we want our questions answered we'll have to go to Alan. Frustrating but understandable. 
Got my client API scenario testing cleaned up and PQAed with Emily after I PQAed one of her's. It was nice having her fill in since Drake and Justin were gone. 
After work My mom arrived, but we had one more swim lesson to get to. So I took Lucy and we went to her swim lesson. She needed to go potty part way through so I took her to the family bathroom. She said it was scary so we instead went to the mens room and did her business there. The swim lesson wasn't terribly informative I feel. But I'm not sure what you do with a 3 yearold for teaching them to swim. So I guess it makes some sense. 
After we got back from the pool we headed off to supper at silk road. I had the szechwan chicken. It wasn't to spicy really. I avoided eating the peppers though (I later tried to eat one but they were terrible texture. Like eating paper or plastic. I ignored the rest). Lucy got her birthday presents from Gigi at that time. 
We got home and shortly there after Gigi headed home. I then worked on my garage door controller until it was time for bed. 
Saturday I got up and made Almond Rubarb muffins. After breakfast I got to work on the number of things I wanted to accomplish that day. It was a pretty productive day of a lot of little things. I started by getting our old vacume cleaner out of the garage and using it to clean our two rugs. Having someing with bristles made a huge difference. The rugs feel much better now. Then I mopped the floors. Vacummed out the sofa. Then I finally got to work on other things. I ran to the hardware store bought a bracket and mower oil. I ended up not needing the bracket since I had some lying around that I could use. Returned it later in the day when I bought some grass seed. Got home and changed the mower's oil. Then I made some pegs to drive into the ground and hold the cover of the mystery hatch down. Finally I moved on to the rotten cherry stump. The last use of the chainsaw I got from Dad. 
This wore me out quite a bit, but I eventually got the stump cut level with the ground. Then I made four cuts each direction making a 5x5 grid. The chain saw was struggling with the tougher outer wood so I decided rather than trying to cut it all out, I'd just break it a part. I grabbed my sledge and beat the roots until they broke apart and I could got the hard parts down a couple of inches below ground level. Covered it in dirt, gathered all the scraps and called it a day on the stump.
I then relaxed for a while and played Valheim while Lucy slept. After she awoke we went out to runnings and got some mulch and some flowers. I planted the front flower bed, the tulip bed. We spent about 25$ on all the flowers. I hope I did a good job planting them. With that done that was my day. I showered and tried to do some other productive things. 
I wanted to knock off some of the activities sitting on my habitica to do list. First off the docket was the phone signal strength question. The data I gathered was unfortunately not as through as I had hoped we'd be able to achieve. But it was enough to say that US Mobile provided a more consistent signal than Republic Wireless, so we'll be jumping ship. Haha! Informed decission! I also did a couple other little things before I settled into some Valheim to call it an evening.
Sunday I got up and had breakfast, went to rehearsal. Came back and was super tired so I took a nap while Megan and Lucy finished getting ready for church. Because of this I managed to stay awake through church. Had a good conversation with Derek after church about chain saws amongst other things, they are getting pigs appearently. Derek is not amused, "I'm not a livestock guy" he said. 
After church we had lunch, I played some Valheim in anticipation of playing with Skylar after ultimate. Was a few minutes late to ulimate because I was playing Vlaheim, but I seemed to be right on time for the group as a whole. It was a good game. I had one heroic catch. The disc was coming in low and a little behind me. I managed to fall backwads and catch the disc just before it touched the ground, like my hand was on the ground. I little of an impact to my chest as a result. Unfortunately we fumbled the next pass, just shy of getting a point. 
Played Valheim with Sky. He decided I was his Jarl since I already had a fort built up. I took him sailing, he helped me finish the crypts in the swamp, and finally we went to exploring in the swamp where the next boss fight will be. I need to setup a portal to said swamp. But he logged shortly after we got there. I tried to continue but that ended up being a poor choice. It was late and I got ganked. It might have pulled it of if it wasn't for the oozer. I logged myself at that point and went to make supper, it was 4:36. 
Made ball park brat pizza and watched a Phineas and Ferb movie. For a made for TV movie it was pretty good. We genuinely enjoyed it. 
I read some of the Microservices book, then watered the freshly sown grass, then we went on a walk. After that I played Valheim for a little bit more. I got back to my body (dragging a deathsquitto into the swamp with me, classic.). I scopped out most of the rest of the swamp, ran away from an abomination in the process. Then as I was getting to the end of the swamp I ran into ANOTHER abomination. And I thought "wait, this could be fun." And I kited him out into the plains. He killed several deathsquittos and fullings. I took him to the tar pit, but appearently the growths are the same faction. So that didn't work. I scrapped him off on the lox after that. That worked. It was funny. But I was also late to bed at this point so I logged as soon as I got my inventory cleared. 
### June 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Garage Door controller nearing completion
2. Air Conditioning
3. Friends.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Hot babe.

Entry

Yesterday's work was pretty good. Of course I would have liked it to be faster but it was pretty good. I got most of the billing scenario testing working. I need to refine some of the more complicated paths yet, but it's all coming together quite well. We had had a meeting for defining pitches that I was a little less focused than I ought to have been. It sounds like I'll continue testing for the most part next cycle but will also finish up the ClientAPI migration. 
I forgot about swim lessons and so Megan reminded me at 4:45. I quickly pushed my daily update and then changed into my swim suit. We got to the pool and it was a nice day for aquadic exercise. I was sweating just from the walk there. I'll be very happy when next month rolls around and I can get a digital lap counter.
After swimming we came home and made supper. I sat down and read my microservices book, finishing out the chapter. 
After that I decided to tackle the slowly draining sink upstairs. I figured I wouldn't have enough time to do much of impact on the garage door controller ince it was already 8:50. But snaking the drain didn't end up taking very long so I went down and worked on the garage door controller. To my great delight I actually finished it for the most part. I think it is ready to be installed on the ceiling of the garage! huzzah! Hopefully everything continues to work just fine, it will be a pain in the neck to debug once it is up there. 
I was musing while I was swimming that I did the garage door first because it felt like the easier of the two ESP projects I had slated. The distributed nodes project seemed harder, but in retrospect it's just a collection of simple tasks. The garage door controller had a lot more constraints on it. I had to not only ready the 4 sensors, I had to also do logical considerations on them to create meaningful garage door states. So in a way I'm looking forward to doing the distributed nodes project as it should have a much more palpable progress.
### June 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Progress on the distributed nodes
2. A fun evening with the Tiahrts
3. Success in temptation resistance

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes free food as much as I do.

Entry

Yesterday work went well. Completed the billing scenario testing round 2, shaped my pitches for next cycle, and then started the 3rd round of mock test for client API. It would be awesome if I could mock out all 18 routes that remain, but I'm trying to keep my expectations in check. 
After work was swim lessons as usual. I struggle with them a little bit as it some times feels like Lucy's not learning anything and we may as well just call it pool play time. But when her lessons were forced into deeper water on Monday it seemed like it actually was pretty good. I don't know. Hopefully she's learning, that's what matters. 
Arthie was with us because Sabrina and Skylar are going to catholic classes. They are seriously considering catholisism, which is interesting to say the least. It sounds like the catholics have a worse rap than they deserve amongst evangelicals. So we'll see how this goes. After swimming we got some icecream and started heading home. We got caught by a Maloney realestate rep on the way who said that they were hosting a bbq in the park for free. We like the sound of free food so we decided we would go, but we needed to head home first and meet up with Tiahrts to get Arthie back to them.
In order to motivate Arthie to keep moving I said Lucy was chasing him. he proceeded to make me jog the entire way home, long after Lucy wasn't even visible anymore. Eventually we all got home, got changed, told the Tiahrts about the bbq and we all went to the park for dinner. Had some casual chat with them. Amanda showed up as well. 
After dinner I stayed at the park with Lucy for Lulu time. We stayed there until she needed to go potty. I tried to offer her the potty in the park but she said it was a scary potty so we went home. I worked on my distributed nodes until it was time to clean for the robot. 
Lucy isn't currently falling asleep in our bed. Who knows if she'll got back to it. Instead she falls asleep to little worship company in her little bed. Kinda nice, kinda annoying. She usually isn't asleep before we are, that part is annoying. 
Ok, one other issue I need to talk about, that I decided to leave to the end here. Megan left me alone in the morning and walked to the library. I was tempted to look at some porn. Like really hard, felt like I was going to vomit. But by the grace of God I did resist. I wrote about it while it was happening and that seemed to help. This was good, later that evening, less so. While I was at the park there were these two young girls in skimpy bikinis. (actually I say a lot of nubile breast tissue the entire time we were at the pool. There was a lot to oogle). I stared at them basically every chance I got, particularly relishing in the opportunities to stare when I knew it was impossible for them to notice. This was certainly a failure. I've heard it said that simply seeing a scantily clad female is not a sin, but the lingering gaze is. My gaze didn't quick so much linger as dig in a trench for continue observation.  
### June 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Distributed nodes project coming together
2. Beautiful weather
3. A quieter fan

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cares for me sexually.

Entry

Yesteray I worked on mock tests for Client API. It was slow going for the morning and most the afternoon. Admittedly my mind was not on it. Fortunately Megan and I had some time to be intimate after lunch and that cleared my mind significantly. After I got the refactoring work done that I needed to do, it was more or less a copy paste of that template to the other routes. After about 6 hours of effort I managed to do the next two routes in about 5m. Then I started working on a more complicated, but more important route and that took the remaining hour of the day. 
After work was swimming time. I've developed a system of keeping track of my laps by noting when I fall behind in comparison to the minutes I've spent swimming. For the first 4-5 laps the number of laps I've completed is equal to the number of minutes, so my lap counter is -0. But I finish the 5th lap usually at like 5:54 or so, which means I finish the sixth lap at like 7:05. At which point my lap counter is current minute -1. Or 7-1 = 6. It a fair bit easier to do than trying to keep track of the laps individually. Next month though I plan on buying a wearable lapcounter, with that I'll be able to just zone out entirely while I swim. This will make the swim time just a little bit nicer. 
After swimming we came home, Lucy took a rinse, Megan took a shower, I started supper with Lucy's help. We had salmon so I had to pick the pin bones myself. It took me a few tries to get the nack for it and one of the pin bones kept breaking on me and I had to hunt it half an inch into the meat. A little after I finished de-boning the salmon Megan was done showering. Lucy and I prepared the sauce and then I let Megan take it from there. 
I retired to the study to continue work on my distributed Nodes project. This is the project I've been wanting to do for a while were we have copies of a device scattered through out the house that do various things in those spaces. The current design is temperature, humidity, and 433mhz receiver. The last one of those being some what critical. In order to make some of the home automations reasonable we need to have the ability to interact with them quickly. At least as quickly as flipping a switch. The 433mhz recievers allow for little power effecient fobs to be wireless buttons for the system. These are super low latency in comparison to something like wifi. Last night I managed to get the remainder of the features put together for the node. It now has temperature, humidity, 433MHz reciever, a button, a RGB led, and over the air updates. Huzzah! I'll have a bit more work to do to get these things to work together to form a cohesive whole, but a lot of the tricky work is done. Now it's just some general thoughts that need work.
After that I played games with Ben. We cleared another crypt which gave us about 5.5 stacks of Iron. We wanted to do another one but we are pretty sure we've found all the crypts in this particular swamp, so we sailed away home. I then worked on our dock and Ben worked the farm and forges. I started work on a wall to wrap our base and protect it from invasions. But we ran out of time and called it a night.
We finished season 2 of Picard last night. It was rather disappointing. One of the things star trek has done well historically is taking moral stances on things and arguing for them. Surprisingly it's one of the things that is likeable about the show. Standing for human rights and what not. While I don't always agree with the stance they take, it inevitably provokes ones thoughts and hones your contrary stance. There wasn't really any such stance taken in PIC2. And so over all it wasn't really a notable show. Next we watch Kanobi, hopefully it will be a good one. At this point I'm holding to the high hopes and low expectations stance for Kenobi. We'll see. 
### June 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lucy who wasn't a huge pain last night
2. Lucy making progress on swiming
3. A lot of routes done for client API testing.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Sharp as a tack

Entry

Yesterday at work went pretty well in the morning. I accomplished a lot of routes before lunch. After lunch I started work on the activity log route and my progress ground to a halt. It's complicated, it's unlike the other routes. I'm leaning towards doing it as an entirely separate pull request as I think some of the code will also need to be updated to ensure it works correctly.
After work we went to the pool for Lucy's last swim lesson. I'm not sure if we'll have more swim lessons this year, it's possible. We may just take her to the pool and play with sinkies and such.
After the pool, we came back, made some supper and I worked a little on the Distributed nodes. I've got just about everything sorted for the DNodes, but I need to figure out how the MQTT interactions work. I'm getting a little stumped by that. But once I have that sorted I'm sure I'll be able to get it up and running soon. 
I really need to get OTA updates onto the garage door opener before it goes up.
Then we played FFXII till about 9:10. I played "statues" with Lucy after that till about bed time. We started Kenobi last night. It's not bad so far. Here's hoping it gets good. Could not take the inquistors seriously. 
### June 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My Little Lucy
2. Air Conditioning
3. Fans

Thing I love about Megan: 
Got us bacon

Entry

Friday was a pretty ok day. I decided to skip activity log as my last entry suggested I might and so I got all the other routes done in Client API sans that one. So we are in a good position now with some 60+% of the lines in legacyUser.ts tested. And then I did some clean up.
After work I installed the garage door opener on the ceiling of the garage. The sensing didn't quite work as expected at first. For some reason the bottom sensors are reporting meerly ~70cm when the doors are closed. So I lowered the threshold and did an OTA update. I'm glad I figured out how to do such. That worked great. The doors now report correctly in HA. However the button toggling is not yet working. So I'm going to need to debug why when I press the button in HA it doesn't simulate a button press opening or closing the garage.
I forget what else I did friday evening.
Saturday I grilled us some breakfast. We had breakfast brats, there weren't anything to write home about, but I wont' turn down brats! We then packed up and headed to Gigi's for the mid morning-afternoon. We also grilled there for lunch. We just hung out for the most part. I got my mom going with Bitwarden, hopefully I can get her setup and stable so she can actually get a basis for things. One of the important things I also did was add a link to google docs on her desktop. I had created a help documents folder for her but she wasn't able to find it. So that ended up being basically useless. Now that she has a link to her google drive hopefully we can get some help docs in there that will actually help her. 
After we got home I needed to mow the lawn, but we also needed to make supper. So Megan got started on supper and I started doing the triming, which I've neglected all year. I was nearly done with the triming when she came out and got me. I light the grill, but appearently didn't light it right and was able to finish most of the triming before the steaks went on. They were on for about 2 minutes before I finished the triming. I pulled out the mower and did one lap around before I stopped to check the steaks which were done already, to my surprise. Part of this was I set the temp to 140. So a little rare. Megan wasn't entirely approving but the flavor was good so we were pretty happy with the result. Honestly some of the best steaks I've made.
Sunday was pretty relaxed. Lucy managed to spend the entire sermon down in children's message. Maybe we'll finally be able to get her to be happy without her parents around. After church I relaxed and played some valheim. Then it was time for ultimate, which we ended up calling about 10 minutes early because it was so hot and windy. We weren't really accomplishing anything.
Played some more Valheim. Tamed the Lox outside my base. Saddly one of them proceeded to die shortly there after, but it looks like he took out 4 fullings in the process. Skylar didn't join me this week as he was keeping brody company instead.
We had our first date night in months last night. We watched spiderman no-way-home. It was a pretty good movie. I was pleased. 
Made love twice yesterday. It was nice after having so little time for intimacy recently. And because it's so hot we don't even want to cuddle these days. 
### June 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. Fresh air
3. Time to read

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is flexible

Entry

Yesterday's work was a bit a drift. I managed to accomplish a number of things, most of my cool down todo list. But overall I didn't feel very productive. 
After work we were going to go to the pool. But Lucy fell asleep. So I went by myself. We tried waking her several times that evening but nothing was working. Her nap so throughly out of whack lead to a rather unpleasant slumber, espectially when compounded with the heat. 
Most of the evening I spent reading microserivces. I estimate that I've got ~5 hours of reading left. If I get a bit in every night I should finish it by the end of the week.
### June 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. The book "Extreme ownership" that was recommended to be being available on Libby.
2. Lots of wood for free!
3. Cooler days that expected.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is productive

Entry

Yesterday at work I did mostly some cleaning up of my PRs to get them through. There was a some panic at the end of the day that turned out to be unwarrented about routing. We are sorting that out today.
After work was pool time. We went to the pool and I stayed with Lucy while Megan did her water walking. After that we had supper at the pool, which wasn't to bad but did leave me a bit hungry. I stayed at the pool with Lucy for almost another hour for Lulu time. It wasn't terribly engaging as it was basically just me watching her play. Not a lot of interaction. But she loved it. So that's good. 
On the way home I noticed a bunch of wood in the hospital's dumpster. After changing I decided to go dumpster diving and retrieve as much of it as I felt I could manage. There was a HUGE pallet in there with a ton of nice wood, but I doubt I could have fit said palet into Urbosa, let alone onto my wheel barrow. So I abandoned that but still came home with probably 100$ worth of lumber (less the decreased value from nail holes). I then spent about an hour and half extracting the nails. I didn't like the idea of leaving a bunch of giant metal spikes exposed in the garage that I or Lucy could get hurt on so while it was a distraction from my intended goal of reading micro services, it was good to do. I started listening to "Extreme Ownership" while I did it. I think the book will be helpful to me. It's not really all that novel a concept to me, it's something I had already taken to heart and I feel is a very Christian message "You are responsible for everything under your influence" in short. Just like how only you are responsible for your own salvation, no one can accept Christ on your behalf. 
After that I tried to put the extra door we had onto Lucy's room but was defeated because the hinges go the wrong way. BLAST! why must doors be so complicated. :c I'll route the hinge slots down so that they can be reversed and then continue my plan to install the door. 
Then it was time to clean for the robot and get ready for bed.
In the morning, i forget what it was exactly that dug into me, but I wanted to check something and that lead me into porn. I marked that I gave in at first, but while Megan was off on a walk I came back and finished the video I had started and watched another so I marked yesterday as a "continued". I thinking that evening after having read the first 1.5 hours of "Extreme Ownership" I realized why my change of tactic from purity to honest has been so powerful in fighting porn. It demands I own it. When I'm honest with my self, when I don't make any excuses, there is less place for porn to hide. When I'm just focusing on purity I can try to excuse it as being tired that day, or having gone a long time without intimacy, or blame it on some other external factor. But that's not right. I am to blame. I am responsible. I can change when I'll be tired, I can change when the devil will tempt me, but I can change what I do in those situations. 
### June 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Megan giving me a hair cut.
2. An early bed time for Lucy
3. Tasty treats

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cuts my hair and keeps me looking hansom.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. Got things rolling a bit. Over all I feel like maybe the sudden relief of presure from being in cool down is sapping my motivation to keep being productive.
After work I read a little while Megan was getting groceries. She ended up forgetting tomatoes so I went to the store as well and picked up the tomatoes but also some plastic shoe boxes for my nintendo collection. Some day I'd like to have a really nice set of cases to house all the hardware, but for now I'm happy with just having any sort of case, and these were about 1.40$ each. A good place to start.
We had supper, and then Megan cut my hair. While she was cutting my hair Lucy fell asleep watching Bluey. When my hair cut was done I took Lucy up and put her down on her bed in our room. She stirred a bunch but ended up calling it bed time and slept most of the night there. She did end up waking up at 5ish in the morning though and watched little worship company till I got up for the last time at 6:54. 
After I put her down, I showered, and then came down and played Valheim with Ben. I finished the stone wall around our base and then I set sail to get to Bone Mass's Island. It took me the rest of the evening but I got there and setup a portal. We now have a connection to the new island. I'm interested in doing some exploring further in hopes of finding Haldor. But that will have to wait till next week. 
### June 24th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy going to bed early
2. A nice calm day
3. Progress on my automation projects

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is great at working with Lucy.

Entry

I acomplished a fair bit yesterday, got myself unstuck. But I ran into a problem that I don't have a way to get around at this point. I'm going to have to do some research after I finish writing this entry.
After work I went out and joined Megan, Lucy, Arthie, and Kynlie. Tiahrts were here well their parents went to catholic classes. I mostly just did some yard work. I trimmed some dead branches out of the crab apple tree, it was significantly easier with the sawzall. I could hold the saw at arms length and still clip the branch off with ease. There were a couple branches though that were out of my reach. Maybe I'll climb again with the sawzall on a rope so I can hoist it up rather than have one hand performing double duty holding me and saw. 
After that I made supper and Tiahrts departed. We ate and Lucy started to fall asleep. I gave her a kiss and a hug since I was going to praise band rehearsal and Megan took her upstairs to get her ready for bed. When I returned from praiseband rehearsal she had just fallen asleep on the sofa. So we let the episode of Bluey finish to cement her asleep state and then I took her up. We played FFXII and then went to bed ourselves. Lucy slept the whole night this time. She didn't wake until 7ish. Wonderful! this is what we want! We'll see how today goes. Megan pointed out last night that this will also mean Lucy is officially weened. She didn't have any milk yesterday since she didn't have a nap and didn't have milk to put her to bed. A few days of this and we may break her of needing milk to go to bed entirely. It was pretty perfuctual at this point anyway.
We have one episode of Kenobi left. We went to bed talking about star wars universe stuff. it was delightful. 
### June 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Friends to play Valheim with
2. Calm saturday mornings
3. Open windows

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plays with Lucy

Entry

Friday was an ok day. I joined the review of the cycle and I think my project did fairly well over all. It's not amazing to say that I increased test coverage by 2-3% on billing and 10% on client api, but I learned a lot in the process and will hopefully be able to accomplish more in the future. I did finish the activity log testing after the meeting. Had a PQA with Drake and found some issues I'll have to resolve today.
I don't remember the exact sequence of things but I have marked down on both friday and saturday that I failed pornographically. I'm trying to shift my mind set a little. I think I've been to legalistic about it and need to shift back to focusing on my heart. I've taken the thought that seeing a women in say her bikini isn't a sin and jump to the conclusion that I can therefore stare at women in their bikinis. Which is of course playing with fire. I blame doing such on being a gate way to the hard core stuff. But I need to step back and say "while seeing a women in her bikini isn't a sin, staring, oogling, lusting after her is." So I've kind of set up the rule in my head "would I look at this in front of Megan?" It's not a perfect rule but it is a pretty good stand in. If I'm choosing to leave my work computer and go to my currently un-protected personal computer, that suggests I know what I am doing is wrong. 
After work, we went to the pool. Swam my laps, and we came home. Made some supper and I read and fiddled with my projects.
Saturday morning I made Chocolate Chip Banana bread and after breakfast we headed off to Sioux City. Met Dave and Tonya for Lunch and hung out at a park. I tried dropping a hint that they missed my birthday this last year, but they didn't catch it so I'm just going to shrug and carry on. Not a big deal. I was mostly hoping for some good presents and I'm not so greedy (or at least I don't want to be so greedy) that I would drive the point home just for that. 
After we left them we went to a store so Megan could pick out a new swim suit. I sat by the changing room and mused about automation. Which got me to thinking about robot arms. And then I realized I could use a robot arm to help me do percision work on electronics, like a micro minipulator of sorts since it should be able to do milimeter level percission. I thought about it more and realized that doing a gantry would probably be easier and more reliable, at least at first. An arm would be smaller and more flexible. But I want to give the gantry idea a try and see if I can get a my virtual boy repaired.
We got home and I started fiddling with the garage door controller. Turns out my Optocouplers are just not powerful enough to trigger the garage door button. I ended up using a relay instead. I've ordered a dual relay board to complete the project and it should be here tomorrow. Then I'll have both position detection and control over both garage doors. No more accidentally leaving the garage door open all night. But the optocouplers being wrong is a motivating factor in me wanting to learn more about analog electronics. I feel like I've just kind of ignored that world to my detriment. Both in terms of gotchas like these, and potentially simpler solutions to problems if I only knew the analog way of doing it.
Sunday morning came and I did some reading before going to church. Elder Tiahrts invited us (and Amanda and younger Tiahrts) to lunch. Sat with Raleigh and Amanda and chatted about Roe v Wade being over thrown. Praise the Lord! I talked to Tom briefly after supper and asked him for a recommendation on a book to read on compilers. Maybe I'll read it next quarter. It appearently is a doosy of a book, but that sounds like about what I'm looking for right now. Rich content that I can sink my teeth into. 
After that we went home and rested for a bit before rejoining everyone for ultimate frisbee. It was a good game, but I'm still not on a winning team. Oh well. It's been fun none the less. Adison (Kleinsaur?) joined us late in the game. I didn't realize she was still in the area. 
After ultimate we went home and played Valheim, again, together. It was a blast. There was a bit of a "herding cats" feel to it but it was a lot of fun. The dynamic of it being my world that they are joining me to play in changes the nature of the game a bit in fun ways. It's not a free for all team, I am the definitive leader, I decide what we are doing, I assign people tasks. I of course want to keep everyone entertained but I am the defacto leader of the group. They even call me the Jarl. It's all tongue in cheek of course but it's fun as a result. The first thing we did was I took everyone on a lumbering adventure. We went to spawn and cleared a bunch of trees. I showed them how to use the elder power to speed up the process. They figured out how to use the portal and bring all the wood back over encumbered. 
After that we attempted to sail to the swamp, this went histarically bad. I dropped them off but then realized I forgot the crypt key. So I sprinted home which turned out to be an aweful idea since I ran across a bunch of stuff. Raleigh died while I was fetching the key so I had him follow me back. He got lost. He seems to have a really bad sense of direction. He died again. I got back, I sailed away to go pick up Raleigh. As soon as we were getting back the sun was setting and so we were now trying to defend our selves in the swamp at night. I called a retreat but skylar died, I died, Raleigh died. We told Brody to just log. We went to bed, and then he logged back in. Our boat had been destroyed in the choas so I built a Karve this time and we sailed back to where it had been. Raleigh ran the wrong direction to get his inventory. But eventually we all got everything and loaded back into the Karve and I sailed us home. It was 5:00 at this point but I decided to play a little longer since we weren't going to do pizza for supper. 
Once we got back and everyone was back in good spirits I took them through a portal instead and we went dungeon crawling in a crypt. This went very well. High spirits by the end of it, we harvested 138 iron scrap. Next week we'll be able to get two full sets of armor out of that. But we'll still need to get it out of the swamp! xD
After games I cleaned the kitchen, did some prep work. I was able to make use of 3 fresh herbs while making our ranch dip for the week. That was pretty satisfying. I also refilled our ranch packs, using 3 of our dried herbs for that. also satifying. 
We had left overs for supper and then watched "Jerry and Marge Go Large" a movie about a retired couple who gamed the lottery in Michigan and Massachusets. It was an enjoyable movie.
Started watching "Wandavision" last night for our long show. It was interesting seeing a modern take on old style TV shows. All the while they were building up the "Something doesn't feel right here" vibe. I'm thinking it has something to do with Wonda going crazy.
### June 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Friends to play valheim with
2. Hope for more children
3. Progress at last on transferring Megan's phone number

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves all our children, even the ones we never met.

Entry

Yesterday at work I was fairly distracted through most of the morning. Hopefully I can still accomplish something this morning yet but it is so far panning out like wise. But by the end of the day I had managed to get legacyUser.ts's test coverage up to 93%! not bad. And I finished cleaning up my PRs for Drake.
After work we went to the pool, I did my lap swim. This week should be the last week I need to manually count my laps. I hope by next monday I'll have a lane counter ring. 
After the pool I read, till about 8:45. Then I played some Valheim. I'm getting close to finishing the book, just half a chapter and an afterward to read. Hopefully I can finish it today. 
### June 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Finishing Building Microservices (It was a hefty book)
2. The end of the quarter coming
3. A good book in the "Extreme Ownership" book.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is hot and sexy (but currently mostly hot, it is very hot. So much sweat)

Entry

Yesterday was nice. I finished up my testing on the testing for legacyUser. 99% coverage! It would be neat to see similar coverage for all our microservices but Todd pointed out that you can easily go overboard with testing and end up making a lot of tests that provide no value. I want to figure out how to quantify how much of our code base is covered that ought to be. 
After work we went to the pool. From pool to Supper. After supper we lounged a bit and then made love. And then I continued reading the Building Microserivces book and finished all the chapters. Huzzah! Finished the book. Took me quite a while. Two Quarters. Then played Valheim for a little before bed.
### June 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A calm week
2. Fun games
3. Roe v Wade being over turned.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants more children, some how.

Entry

Yesterday was quiet slow. Two weeks of cooldown are a bit much. But I got the afterward of my microservices book finished, that's good. A coworker found a problem in client api early afternoon so things picked up for me a little as I attempted to resolve that problem.
After work it was not pool time. Instead it was time to make supper. It didn't go great to be honest. We tried making taqituos from scratch and getting the rolling and frying just right can be a little bit of a trick. I think I had it down by the time we got to the last 3 though. Maybe if we try again it would go better. 
After supper it was Lulu time. We started to go to the park with her on her new balance bike, we got to the end of the drive way before we turned back and switch to tricycle. She got about 5 feet on that before she gave up. I told her to go another 20 and then we could leave the trike behind. through much screaming and gnashing of teeth she managed to get that far. She just gives up on things so easily it feels. I don't know how to help her over this yet. We then walked to the play ground, played for a little, and then came home and went on a pretend trip. We camped in the porch and then we played on the playground that was conveniently attached to our camp site. We played there for a while and then I went in to play games with ben.
I spent most of my evening searching for Haldor with no success. Frustrating little bugger, where is he? 
After games we went to bed. Lucy had her first attempt at mouth wash yesterday, she wasn't to bad. But she takes only the tiniest amount in her mouth at a time. 
### July 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A sharp mind
2. Fans
3. Friends for Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is also very sharp.

Entry

Yesterday was a lot of hitting my head into a wall. Trying to figure out how some old code worked. I never did figure it out, but at the end of the day Chris Tobey explained it to me and filled in the key missing bits of information that got it all to click for me. 
Tiahrts dropped off Arthie again around 4 yesterday to go to their Catholic classes. After work I found them happily playing together while Megan was working on the menu. I went outside to setup the sprinkler since it has been a hot dry week. My sprinkler migth be a little broken. It didn't seem to stay engaged and would just sit there. I may have to take it a part and figure out what's going on. 
Tiahrts picked up Arthie just as we were about to sit for dinner, what close timing! After supper we played FFXII. We didn't really make it anywhere story wise but we did get through some of the traveling we needed to do. We did however do a lot of tweaking of equipment and gambits and licenses. There is a certain level of enjoyment in just tweaking configurations so I'm not complaining. But hopefully next week we can get back to some story bits. 
### July 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. To live in what is still the freest country on earth
2. To be able to worship my God as I please (and as he leads me)
3. A new quarter's journal already complete.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me.

Entry

I finished up allowing guardians, admins, and partners to see a user's information. It was a little slow going considering it was the day before a 3 day weekend. But I got it done before the day finished.
After work we went to the pool. I swam for the last time without my counter ring that came on sunday. It will be nice to be able to focus on something other than what lap I am on. After work I modeled the box for the dual relay module I got off amazon. I tried doing it with Sketchup but was really unimpressed with the results. I went back to blender and I think I'll focus on learning more modern ways of using blender going forward rather than learning sketchup.
Played some Valheim.
Saturday morning I made chocolate scones and afterward tried to finish up the garage door controller. With the new relay box in hand I had everything I needed. It took me a while, but I eventually got the box installed, the controller reprogrammed, and everything wired up. We now have position detection and control for both the garage doors. the one last thing that would be neat to have is error detection, but I'm not going to press my luck at this point. I'm happy to just get the work done. 
We went to "bow creek recreation area" late saturday morning to discuss the quarter. The area was pretty nice and really out of the way. They have primitive camping there and I think we'll make use of it in the future. 
THe review of our quarter went pretty well. I didn't accomplish quite as much this quarter as I had hoped, but I think I have shifted my mind set enough on the home assistant front. I now think in a much more home assistant way. Moving forward that should be pretty useful. 
After our review and we got home I started doing the yard work. I mowed the lawn and was nearly done with my book so I decided to sit and pick rocks out of the ground. I have been fairly motivated by "Extreme Ownership" and I think I'll recommend it to Josh. I hope I can hold on to this motivation for more than a few days. Fortunately I have a pretty solid indicator. One of the things it motivated me to do was to wake up promptly with my alarm. Since Megan has been rolled towards me in the mornings more often recently this is relatively easy. How long I maintain this will provide some indicator.
I tried to take apart my tractor sprinkler to figure out why it isn't moving and haven't had any luck getting it's transmission all the way open. I'll have to look up more guides on line for such.
Played some Valheim in the evening.
Sunday morning was nice and quiet. Unfortunately because it is a holiday weekend there wasn't a lot of people for ultimate or Valheim (none in the case of the latter). I reminded Tom Tiahrt to bring me the Dragon book, I should have it next week for this coming quarter (and probably the one that follows).
We watched the new Phineas and Ferb movie, it was nice. It's funny how it was made 8 years after the show finished, and the show only ran 4. I wonder who green light that idea. 
### July 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Games with friends
2. A good start to this quarter
3. Most of the hard part of the budget done.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Audit's my work in the budget

Entry

Yesterday was pretty good. I started printing my seedling starter tray first thing in the morning (after having woken up after my first alarm, :success:). I spent most of my morning preparing my next bullet journal. I managed to get the bulk of the work done by lunch and had it printed. After lunch Faders came over and we played "Freedom" a underground rail road game, it was quite enjoyable. Then we played a round of Carcasone. 
After they left we made supper and I did a little bit of pruning in the cursed flower bed. I washed my arms twice and hands thrice after such and so far I seem to be fine. After supper I worked on the budget. I tired of such by around 9, but had finished all the reciepts.
I played Valheim for a while and explored the mountain on my island. This didn't go terribly. I tried climbing to the top of it and ducked out when I saw a warewolf. As I was retreating though I died on a very steep part of the mountain and so my stuff is basically inaccessible. I tried for maybe half an hour to get my equipment to no avail. The main problem was I had to much in my inventory and so simply clicking "e" to retake it results in it just opening the inventory. Lesson learned here: Don't go adventuring with the weight lifting belt. It will cause you to not be able to retake your inventory. I think I can get close and then use a pick axe to level the ground near it so I can walk out to it and retake it. It's supper annoying that I have to do it that way though.
After some relaxing we went out to watch the fireworks. Watching them from the highschool is a pretty good option. But I would like to get close enough some time to really feel them. We'll see.  
### July 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice thunderstorm late in the day.
2. Devops book club coming up.
3. Nice things

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is really a lovely lady.

Entry

Start of the new cycle! Vroom! Made a new folder in my notes repo and started up work. Unfortunately problems from last week jumped up into the way. So I've not gotten much actual work done yet. But I fixed issues Justin saw in my username.json PR and solved outage issues from last Friday. Hopefully today I can get some routes moved.
It started down pouring at about 16:15 yesterday so obviously the pool was closed. So after work, aside from enjoying the rain, I went and did my exercise downstairs lifting weights. I got up from the basement and pinned to go back down into the basement where it was nice and cool. 
After supper we finished the budget and then after that I read in the DevOps Handbook until about 21:00. I wanted to relax a little bit and I have the cash in Habitica so I played some Valheim. I was trying to get the iron scrap back from the swamp. There was an abomination roaming around in my path so I had to be very careful. But I eventually got it all there and loaded into a Karve right as a storm started. Grrr. I tried to sail none the less and of course a sea serpent shows up. I run aground to try to protect myself, the storm clears, appearently the serpent gets killed by leeches while I wasn't watching, and I die to a group of draugrs, skeletons, and a blob. I come back, pick up my stuff, try to sail out and get stuck on a sand bar, finally break free of this comedy of errors and start sailing. All this time Megan and Lucy have been cleaning for the robot and so I'm also feeling kinda bad for not helping. I start cleaning while my ship, uneventfully, sails home. 
### July 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Christian friends
2. A freedom loving country.
3. Free Audible Audio books

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is deep and theological.

Entry

Yesterday morning I looked at what I needed to accomplish for the DevOps handbook book club taking place tomorrow morning. I realized I was going to have a hard time reading all the pages I need to read. Then I realized that I could get the audio book on audible. So I signed up for audible again and got another free trial of 3 months. I'm just milking Audible at this point it feels. I leave and come back and get free books. 
I also got some work done. Got John Lauro's attention and got routes migrated. I'm closing in now. Just 2 routes left to do. 
After work I made supper. We grilled fish. This is the first time we've grilled white fish. It honestly could have stayed on the grill a little longer but we were running short on time. It was very good. Also, salting the first by placing it on a bead of salt and covering it in salt also probably added to the flavor. 
Went to Tiahrts to discuss Catholasism with them. My overall opinion of Catholasism is it is just a lot of extra. I've referred to it in the past as Christianity+. It sounds like we'll have another week at least of discussion. I'm happy for the Tiahrts even if I don't terribly understand it all. Based on some of the things they've said it would seem to me that I would not be let into the catholic church since I find some of the stuff esposed irrelevant to salvation. 
Was late getting to Valheim with Ben. But still managed to find Haldor and setup a portal to the mountains. Next week I hope to start preparing the battle grounds for our fight with Bonemass.
### July 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Mobile work
2. Nice neighbors at our camp site
3. Rain to water the earth

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is willing to roll with my crazy work camping idea.

Entry

Yesterday I got the assistance I needed to finish setting up an enumerated from Justin after our morning stand up. Then I tried pushing another route to production, which didn't end up working. We had to roll back and I have no idea what's going on. I finished the other things Justin commented on in my PR, took me a little as I had to rewrite the SQL queries. I do like JOINs, i just think it's easier to think in sub queries. 
After work we packed up and headed out to camp! This is going to be our first adventure doing work camping. And of course, because we have gone camping it rained! not a trivial amount by the time it was done. We managed to get the camp site setup mostly without getting wet. When we went to setup our kitchen and try to make supper our neighboors came over and gave us an umbrella. It was aweful nice of them. It's nice to have an umbrella now. I read the DevOps hand book and we just chilled for the rest of the evening avoiding the rain. It was a nice evening really. Now it is the next day and I am sitting at my little floor desk. This looks like it will work well!
### July 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A successful work camping experiment!
2. A way to hang a fan in our tent. 
3. Fun for Lucy on the playground.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is adventerous

Entry

Had meetings Friday morning. It was fun attending them from our campsite. Then did some PQAs, and other bits of fiddling. Didn't really accomplish a whole lot friday to be honest as it was mostly waiting on people.
After work I forget exactly what we did. It was mostly lounge around the camp. We didn't really do much the entire weekend to be honest, it was very hot. But we took naps and Lucy played on the playground a lot. At one point I strung up the fan on the top of the tent like a ceiling fan. It was quite nice. Megan didn't want to leave the tent. Saturday morning we took a walk that ended up being mostly in the sun, and then in the evening we took a walk just before bed time. IN the first case I carried Lucy most of the way. I would have preferred a better way to carry Lucy than in my arms, but as a form of strength training I wasn't to upset at walking with an extra 30 lbs. 
Sunday morning we watched church from Camp on my work laptop. It worked rather well. After church Lucy did not want to leave. She was really enjoying the playground and was very upset at it being taken from her. We got home, had lunch, Lucy took an nap and I went to play ultimate. When I returned Lucy had just woken up and was appearently asking when we could go back to the playground. We told her that we weren't going camping again for a while but we were going to go on a trip in a few weeks. Her first question "Will there be a playground there?" xD Single minded now. Must find play ground! It is cute.
Played some Valheim with Skylar. We beat bonemass so we are now on to the mountain biome. We managed to find some silver by pure luck before we called it an evening. Sky got enough back that I was able to make a Lox cap because I unfortunately fell down a cliff and died when I tried to return. The lox cap allowed me to stay warm when I went back to retrieve my affects. 
Watched Charolettes web last night. The mistakes of the attempt to watch the show at NWC still sting. It's not just the mistakes though if I am to be honest. I feel awkward any time I go to a theatre performance, particularly at NWC. The particular event of Charolettes web though was a water shed moment. It was the moment I realized I was a stranger at NWC. I was no longer welcome in places that were not explicitly for the public. Changing my version to just acknowledge that I am now an outsider will make that some what better. But still, I wish I knew why I feel weird at just about any theatre production. Maybe I should shut up more?
After the movie I played a little more Valheim and reached the summit of the mountain on my island. That was fun. Went to bed. 
### July 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Extra money for plasma donating
2. Megan on board with my plans for server fun times.
3. My new lap counter ring working great!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is willing some times in the middle of the night.

Entry

Yesterday at work went pretty well. We started off the day with a choatic round of happy birth sung by our marmots for Cheryl. It was a beautiful disaster. After that I did some PQA and worked on my two problems. Device registration and Applog. Discussed some things with Mark and made progress on polishing up device registration and getting it out the door. Still a little bit to be done on it. Applog is still a mystery. 
After work we went to the pool. I had my first experience with my new lap counter ring. I forgot on my very first lap, doh. So I had to operate minus 1 for the rest of the session. I pushed myself. I swam 16 laps in breast stroke and 8 laps in crawl. It was tiring. But I can't expect progress if I never push. I'm hoping it will also help with my self control.
Speaking of self control. Had some fairly strong temptation during the day. I felt sick, like I had been punched in the stomach. A withdrawl symptom I'm fairly certain. It's been 16 days by my reckoning since I last indulged in fantasy or pornography. Historically I believe that would put me at the point where I am at the strongest craving. So it isn't surprising that I'm struggling with strong temptations right now. We had hoped we'd have some time to ourselves last night before bed, but Lucy didn't fall asleep until after our show. Never the less I woke up a little before midnight and started gropping Megan and the sick to my stomach feeling came back. I told her I didn't think I could wait till the next day and so she concented to some loving then. I was ferocious. I could bearly contain myself. 
After the pool, we had supper, and I went to donate plasma. I got 120$ towards my plans of setting up some server equipment in our basement. I discussed my plans with Megan after I got home while we were taking a pre-bedtime walk. Megan concented to the plans I had for mutual benefit, new high quality HDDs and new AP and router, and then I'll cover the other things myself pertaining to the nicer server equipment and such. I like this plan.
### July 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Days that were cooler than expected
2. A little Lucy who is starting to get some of the ideas of swimming
3. A cycle that is going well

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys Skyrim

Entry

Yesterday at work went fairly well. I was able to dig in and figure out what was wrong with my applog route and if the reviews all go well it should be ready to be pushed globally today. I also did some PQA and attended to some issues in username.json for Mark. Things are going swimingly.
After work was pool. After pool supper. After supper Lulu time. We went to do the story walk, Lucy lost interest part way through and we just played on the play ground. We came home and had some ice cream and Lucy fell asleep on Megan's lap as I started working on a reset of my phone. Cleaned for the robot and frantically pieced together enough of my phone to have my alarms and such in place and call it a night.
### July 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Audio book of the dev ops hand book
2. Mostly prepared suppers
3. Flexible schedules

Thing I love about Megan: 
Needs some lovin to.

Entry

Yesterday at work I was having a hard time focusing to be honest. I had just reset my phone so I was very distracted by setting it back up. I did my best to minimize the number of apps I install. I think there are currently 84. I've shifted to using book marks instead of apps where that is an option. This approach nixed 5 apps right off the bat. Nice. I did manage to get some work done though. App log is ready to go and started rolling it out late in the day. Fixed soem issues that mark so in username.json, but it turns out that the clients aren't using that feature so my work is more or less for not. 
After work I helped make supper. I wanted to ensure we got on it as soon as possible so I could donate plasma. That failed though as there were some 14 people ahead of me in the queue to donate so I opted out for last night. I'll try again saturday. I still needed to read my dev ops book though. Megan and Lucy had dropped me off at the donation center and went to Hyvee for groceries so I just walked to Hyvee and sat in the car and read. Megan got done part way through my reading so I finished up at home. Shortly there after played games with Ben. 
We finally beat Bonemass last night. That was exciting. We can no move on to the mountains. It was supper laggy for a little while though. Like 8 or more seconds of lag, but it was running on my computer so I don't really understand how that works. 
### July 15

Things I'm thankful for


1. Plants that are starting to grow
2. Further understanding in FFXII
3. Friends for Lucy to play with

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is trying to be a little more social for Lucy's sake.

Entry

Yesterday I convinced myself that the problem with device registration is the movers not pointing to the new redis servers. Put in a ticket to attempt to resolve that issue. Got applog pushed out which just leaves username.json left to tackle. It was a pretty quiet day all things considered since I am mostly waiting on people to do things for me. So I started looking into testing which is what I'll be doing in the second half of this cycle. 
After work we went to the pool. Lucy and I played while Megan water walked. We had fun this time because Lucy mostly wanted to go across the lilly pads. This was something that involved me being mostly in the water and actual interaction rather than just sitting there coaxing her to do something, anything, other then just splash around. 
Got home and quickly made supper. Went to praise band rehearsal and was a little late. Came back home and we played FFXII. And again I feel like we are starting to understand the game more. We are making slow progress in the game proper but every week I feel like we understand it a bit better. We could still use some grinding though to level our characters and get them all in nice equipment. 
### July 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain
2. Cleanish garage
3. Book recommendations

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me.

Entry

Friday was ok, pretty quiet. I'm mostly waiting on other people to do things at this point. But I did what I could.
I left work a little early so that we could get done swimming a little early. I only swam 20 laps instead of 24. Then we came home, had supper quickly and then headed off to Tiahrts for Catholasism round 2. It was another great evening with no limiter on it like we had last week. So we didn't end up leaving till almost 10. Got home and went to bed.
Saturday morning I made Salmon breakfest baritos. They weren't terribly notable. Just normal breakfast baritos really. After that I ran to the hardware store and donated plasma. That gets me up 216$ for server equipment. Got home and it was about time for lunch. After lunch we went to the Family Fun day at the National Music Museum. Lucy enjoyed it so we're happy. By the time we were heading home it was gently raining so I was unable to mow the lawn. I started cleaning the garage instead. My mom stopped by for a little. I attempted to clean my desk and then soldered antenas onto my 433mhz radios to improve their range. This worked. The radios now can capture the entire room. 
Sunday morning I decided to do a little experiment. I have all this modafinil lying around in my medicine drawer. I wonder what would happen if I took one. Holy molly. I didn't even nap after lunch. Also, I wasn't terribly hungry all day. So yea, it works. I've not taken any today though for reasons I'll get into shortly. After we got back from church, I wasn't feeling hungry so I went out to mow the lawn since the city stated that our little tall grass prearie attempt needed to be mowed. I didn't disagree. So I mowed it down. None of the flowers seemed to have taken root. I was thinking maybe I'd be hungry after mowning. But I ended up only eating two small bowls of apple sauce. I tried to take a nap but no success, though I hadn't really had a lot of food in my system so I wasn't to surprised by that.
Then it was time for Ultimate. I made an embaressing throw to the other team at one point. But over all it was fun. I've not yet been on a winning team. >.< After Ultimate I took a quick rinse since I was very sweaty from both mowing and from playing ultimate. Then I played some Valheim with Sky. No one else joined us this week either. Kinda sad. I hope other people join again.
Made pizza and watched "Brave Little Toaster" I only ate two slices. Brave little toaster was quite the film. But in a bad way. I would not recommend. It was a sequence of events and not really a story. There was no character development for one thing. 
Went to bed and had a horrid nights sleep. At first I thought maybe it was because I took the modafinil that morning, but Megan and Lucy were also having a hard time sleeping. Our best guess was something in our Sierra Mist since that was the only cominality between us all. I think I got a total of 3 hours of sleep in my 8ish hours of down time. It was rough. I'm sure even more so for Megan.
### July 19th

3. Quiet days to think

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is creative.

Entry

Yesterday at work was pretty good. username.json was rolled out in entirity. Just sensitivity_levels left. Other than that I spent most of the day thinking deep thoughts about testing. 
After work we went swimming. Despite being exhausted most of the day from the horrid night's sleep I actually managed to do 24 laps. Good for me. It was also super duper crowded. I've never had so much traffic in the swim lanes before. 
After work I helped get supper started and then went out to work on setting up drip irrigation in the south berry bed. I'm excited for this. It's first run is going to be tomorrow morning.I managed to get the entire bed covered! Unfortunately I didn't have enough material to go out to the basil plants out in the yard. So I'll need to be sure to give them a good watering before we leave on monday. 
Irrigation work was interupted by supper. After both Megan and I retreated to our bed room for some intimacy. I tried hog tying Megan. It was ok. It had it's challenges. Since I plan on "kidnapping" Megan, hog tying her and throwing her in the back of the car in the near future it's good to know that Hog tying is not the best option for all activities planned. 
I designed a little foam anchor to 3D print with the time that was remaining. I have decent hopes for the anchor but my 3D printer is being troublesome. I'm just not getting good starts these days. I need to figure out what's going on and how to fix it. So that is going to be some quality time with my printer some evening. 
### July 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Tasty hot dogs from the pool
2. Interesting tools to use for testing.
3. A certain level of gumpsion

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is really enjoying Skyrim, turn out to be a great birthday present for her. The switch says she's logged 85 hours.

Entry

Yesterday at work was another relatively quiet day. I did finish up the only outstanding route, that's great news. But I mostly thought about testing.
After work we went to the pool. We had supper at the pool as well, and then Lucy and I stayed and played a little longer. Not as long as I had hoped exactly. Turns out they do a 15 minute break before 7. That meant we went home sooner than Lucy wanted to. Next time I either need to be prepared for that or we need to get out of the house faster. *sigh* I should probably just swallow my selfishness and stay at the pool until Lucy is satisfied. We won't have the pool that much longer in the year.
After the pool I tried to get my 3D printer to work. I've been having issues with print adhession. Several attempts at a number of things all failed. I've order a pair of fresh build plates, maybe that will resolve the issue? I think a BL touch might help as well since I could feel my build plate was not at the same hight from the corners to the center. I ended up giving up for the evening. I'm going to do some more research. 
The other thing I worked on was the window sensors. Unfortunately the cheap ones I found were window "chimes" so to speak. They gave off a blip of radio when the window opened. So I could know when windows open, but no indication on whether they are still open or closed. Not helpful. I may have to make my own sensors. We'll see. 
Then it was time to clean for the robot. Lucy had made a huge mess. It took quite a while to clean up.
### July 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Little cilantro plants
2. Lower heat than projected
3. Progress on quarterly goals

Thing I love about Megan: 
I can bounce thoughts off of her to keep myself sane.

Entry

Yesterday we played the maps I made in generals.io. They were fun. I mostly enjoyed the archipeligo map. After that there was an outage that occured along side a deployment of mine so we rolled back. I had to wait till almost lunch time to get my code back out and running. Got it up, started routing traffic to it. But we didn't get to 100% everywhere before the end of the day saddly. John spotted some things that needed changed in device registration, updated those. Then I started working on billing testing.
After work I sent Alan and email to see if we could potentially meet up while I'm in Owosso. After that I started work on transfering my funds out of SDRS into an IRA owned by me. Turns out this isn't just me being paranoid about pensions, if I don't do this I will forfeit my contributions after 11 years outside of SDRS employ. So yes, I need to get it out. Kept sorting through that until it was time for games with ben.
Ben and I had a pretty good evening. We got the wolf caps we need to stay up in the mountains and had fun going sea serpent hunting. We managed to hunt down 2 serpents. In both cases we got close enough to shore that we managed to gather the scales, and one trophy. We can make a scale shield! Nice. But mostly the hunting of serpents was a lot of fun. 
### July 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A fun missions team
2. Flexible work hours
3. Lucy accepting my mom as a baby sitter

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has gotten a lot better at trying things

Entry

Yesterday I had a fun opportunity to do some intersting work. The clients team is trying to get more of the platforms reporting uninstall requests. It turns out doing the changes to client api was relatively simple. So it wasn't as much works as I had hoped and didn't involve quite as much thought so I was a little disappointed.
After work we car pooled with DeVrieses to go to great shots up in Sioux Falls for our missions team group outting. It was fun. I had never been to a driving range, and I don't know how long it will be before I return. It was fun, but not that fun. Afterwards we went to fudruckers for supper. I enjoy the resturant, but admittedly it's appeal has gone down as I've gotten older. There is a fair bit of naustalgia in my fondness for the shop.
My mom watched Lucy while we were off on the outting. It was nice having the evening with out Lucy. I think this might have been the longest period we've left her alone so far. Lucy was plent happy. 
### August 8th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. My Immune System
2. Vacation
3. Entmoot

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a lovely lady who plans fun vacations.

Entry

Been a while since I last wrote. Between then and now 3 weekends, a vacation, and my first Dev Onsite have happened. I forget what all I did on the first weekend, that's been a while now, and it probably wasn't terribly important anyway. Tom Tiahrt did get me the books promised by that time so I had the "Dragon book" to read during my absence.
The vacation went well. We arrived in Omaha monday evening, the 25th. We ate at the Speghetti Workshop or something like that. It wasn't to bad. Another example of a simple noodles based restaurant. They had a selection of noodles, a selection of sauces, mix and match. Tuesday we went to the zoo. It was not quite as exciting as I had hoped as Lucy was a handful basically the whole time. We had to zip through large parts of exhibits because she was loosing interest. But we got to see Aligators, which was her favorite part of the excersion. And to be fair, the Aligators all swam around when we got there so it was pretty neat. Oh, that was probably her favorite animal related part of the zoo. But they also had a really cool climbing area that Lucy got to run around on that also had a little river for her to play in. It was a good introductory level river for playing, not a lot of surprises like deeper water than you except. She was pretty brave and did some unexpected things like climbing under a bridge. 
Wednesday we went to the Children's museum. Lucy had a lot of fun there. We played on many parts of the museum but in the end her favorite was this tunnel you walk through that spins around and disorients you. It was supposed to give you like an astronaught's experience in zero G by confusing your vistibulary. I wasn't to bothered by it, but I still was, Megan did no like being in it at all. But for some reason Lucy just LOVED the thing. *shrug* There were things that were much cooler in my opinion that she didn't seem that interested in.
Thursday we tried to have a little bit of a day of rest. So, you know, we took a 6 mile walk. We were pretty darn worn out by the time we got to the end of it. But it was a fun walk. We got to see the Omaha City Coal plant. It's interesting to see how different the plant looks in modern context. It is now like what history or movies would portray. Megan and I were lementing that they didn't have any sort of signage explaining what we were looking at to get some idea of what the parts of the coal plant does. Like, why were there 6 smoke stacks. Why did it appear that none were doing anything even though we could hear the plant running. Was the water in the evaporating pools dangerous? There were gease on said water. What were the weird rings near the top of the smoke stacks. How much coal does the plant use in a day? How long can it run on the massive pile it has in it's yard. Does the coal come in primarily by barge or by train? SOOOOOOO many questions. But nope. Coal plants I feel could do a lot for their image with just a little bit of education like that. After the walk we drove to a candy shop and Lucy fell asleep before we got there. This ended up being ok google took us to the wrong candy shop, the one we arrived at did not appear to exist. So we went home and took a rest all of us. Then we went back out and got some candy for Video game night.
Friday we toured the botanical gardens and went to "The Incredible Pizza Machine." for lunch. I enjoyed the gardens and got a few ideas for things to do in our garden. Lucy grew tired of it pretty quickly though. And the gardens are still rather young, like only about 20 years old. So a lot of it is still kinda filling in in spots. Their Japanese garden for one needs a few more years to really become something lovely. They are working on a new visitor center half way through the park so that there is more than a porta poty out there. Also they are rebuilding all their children's gardens so there wasn't much for Lucy to see. We'll have to go back again in a few years and see how things have progressed. The Pizza machine resturant was fun. They had quite the buffet even for an off peak time. Had Lucy not been so worn out we might have stayed and played some of the games, but as it was we didn't see any capacity for getting her off the exciting contraptions any time soon. We went home and I played with her on the play ground just 4ish minutes down the road. She used the potty in the car twice in that time. We were there about 2.5 hours I think. It was quite a while. 
Saturday we went and toured a WW2 ship and the Durham Museum. I really enjoyed the WW2 ship. I dug into some parts of it fairly deeply as I tried to understand how it worked. Specifically I was trying to figure out some of the logistical aspects like: I see launch rails for depth charges, each can hold 3 charges, is that all the ship has and then it has to put back into port? No, there is storage for more below. But how do they get them up? These are 300lb barrels of powder. I never figured that one out. But also the 40mm guns, Said to be able to fire at 160rpm. But the guns only had a magazine of 4 rounds each. Can they even get that much ammo to the gun fast enough to maintain 160rpm for a minute? It didn't look like it. It looked like they had kity litter tubs that held 16 rounds each that they would carry up for below deck by hand. So if they wanted to maintain 160rpm for a minute that would take 10 tubs. That's a lot of volume. My guess is they were capable of that but rarely used it. It appears to have taken some 4-9 men to operate the gun in the first place. There were a couple other questions I had that weren't answered, but I did get to look deeper than usual on the ship. Getting a chance to really think about the logistics. After that we did the Durham Museum which was very eclectic. We really enjoyed seeing the earth dome house recreation and authentic Tepee, 7(?) buffalow hides taned in their brains. It was quite the site. 
Sunday we tried to relax again. We went to a cafe for breakfast and they filled us up good, didn't really end up having lunch. We then tried to go play on a playground and walk a bit, but it was so hot that we didn't stay long at standing bear resivour. We had bagel pizza's for supper and watched a movie that was there entitled "babies" which we though Lucy would be much more interested in than she was.
Monday came and it was day 2 of travel. They dropped me off early in the morning at the air port. I had a pretty uneventful trip in. I flew OMA to ORD to FLT. I saw Cheryl on my second flight, though she was 6 something seats behind me. Picked up my rental car and drove to Owosso. Went to the office first, meeted and greeted. Then went for supper, stopping at the hotel to drop off my stuff. We then walked around town till I was tired and went to bed.
Tuesday was pretty fun. We did more meeting and greeting. Had an all employee meeting and "Delta Stregizer" meeting. Then played games the night away.
Wednesday was highly disappointing. I had been getting gradually sick from something Lucy passed me I'm pretty sure. Wednesday was the big exciting day. High Caliber go carts and archery tag and lots of things. But my fever reached it's peak at that exact time and I was wiped out. I went home having not played any games. It ended up being the only event I missed. If only I had been sick the previous day. *sigh* I was legitimately fighting back tears as I walked out between the exhaustion and the disappointment. I went home, took a nap. my fever broke. I felt much better. Watched "What is a Woman" by Matt Walsh. That evening I was feeling much better and went to play games at Justin's and got to meet Alan. At the end of the evening I got a few details out of Alan about what his understanding of things were, and a few details out of Justin. I don't know if anyone knows all the details at this point, but the best reconstruction of the events I can manage is that Alan's presence caused two other employees to leave. Management freaked out and requested Alan's resignation to stop more employees from departing. I see a lot of potential me in Alan, particularly comments like him being not terribly great at the interpersonal skills. So I take this series of events as a warning. This is something that could happen to me if I ever go into management, or have enough power at an organization to make people's lives uncomfortable.
Thursday I felt much better and was able to join our group in the Escape room event for the day. That was fun. The room was a good challenge and we got almost all the way done with it, we were just two steps from done. After that we went for lunch and then came back and had group time. The group time for us had already started in the ride out and back. It just happened that Drake, Justin, Emily, and I were all in the same vehicle so we chatted a lot. When we got back we decided to make some generals.io bots. We didn't get as far as we wanted to but we did get some things working. I hope to get to some real bots up soon. After that we played Spy Fall and Munchkin until it was time to say good byes and head to bed.
Friday was day 3 of travel. I went to the base for the morning. It was pretty quiet and I just read my book and bided my time. Eventually I decided it was time to get going and I headed out. I met up with Doug and Melinda at the airport as we were on the same first flight. That went down well. I got bumped to an exit row. Unfortunately my flights home were Flint -> Charlette -> Omaha. It was about 1:40 of flight time on the way out, each of my returning flights was longer. 2h to Charlette, 2.5h to Omaha. Plus a 4 hour layover in Charlette. Then my flight from Charlette got delayed by missing attendants. We just ket getting dragged along with no real indication in how much time until we'd be out. In the end it was another 1.5 hours of waiting. I didn't land until 11:20. I was pretty miserable by the time I got to Omaha. We basically went straight to bed.
Saturday, day 4 of travel. We had breakfast in the hotel, packed up, and headed for Trader Joes. After grabbing some groceries we headed out. I noted we had 70m of range so we should stop for gas soon. It ended up being about half way through the trip before we stopped. Comical. We could have accomplished nearly half our trip on the tank we had. Never the less when we got down to 28m I was getting a little antsy. Luckily that was when Onowa showed up. Made it the rest of the way home. Lucy watched Bluey basically the whole way. I unloaded and puttered around the house. Eventually Lucy went down for a nap and Megan and I had some time to be intimate. Then I went and mowed the lawn. It started raining just after I finished so I decided to walk out into the rain with Lucy, it was pretty light. Lucy played a little but inveitably ran back for cover and then played with her mud kitchen while I tried to clear the gutters. Specifically I cleared the down spout on the south side of the porch. It had managed to be come completely filled with debris. I kept blasting more water up the down spout thing I've got to be getting close. Every time I stopped it was fairly clear that I was not. Then suddenly the dam broke and water gushed out of the down spout at me. I got even more soaked. But at least now we shouldn't have over flowing gutters. I still need to do something about the clogging in the lower part of it.
Sunday was uneventful. It was hot. I didn't feel like doing anything. I might have turned the AC on but it never got over 78 outside so that felt dumb. But inside it was closer to 82. After church Megan went to her sunday school teacher's meeting. Lucy ended up being pretty good the whole time Megan was gone. But yea, I didn't accomplish much. I downloaded Ceaser 3 and enjoyed playing that a bit. And I played some Valheim, though no one joined me. I made breakfast pizza for Supper and we watched "The Goonies" which was pretty enjoyable. 
My 3D printer is working again now that I've got a new build surface for it. Feeling the new and old I can see why it stopped working. The new one is much rougher. I completed all the foam anchors I needed to finish the garage door controller project at last. I have some certificate issues that seem to be rooted in DNS issues that aren't my fault that are keeping me from accessing home assistant. It is quite annoying. 
### August 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Cool fresh air
2. Retirement transfered
3. A day to catch up

Thing I love about Megan: 
Very cuddly

Entry

Yesterday was a bunch of catch up. I spent a fair bit of time writing up my last two weeks in my journal. It was a lot of time to cover. And then there were other things to catch up on as well. I was also running a little slow since I'm still feeling a bit sick and tired. I helped Emily and Mark with a particularly annoying bug. And then I started working on billing testing again.
After work we would have gone to the pool, but we were both worn out. So instead we stayed home. I clipped all the flowers off our basil plants to encourage leaf growth. We need to do a basil harvest I think and start making some pesto. I started working on our budget and got all the recipts entered and the first chunk of the budget done. Now I need Megan's assistance for auditing. I think I need to go through the credit card and checking account to. Perhaps this evening. But either way I'll need to discuss slush distributions. 
I also tried to get the last details of my new bank account with First bank and trust sorted. Got my Online account setup and debit card activated. Then hit the sack.
The last few days Lucy has not been sleepy at bed time and it is quiet annoying. 
### August 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. Recovery
3. Naps

Thing I love about Megan: 
Walks places.

Entry

Yesterday's work was again pretty slow going. I'm still recovering to a certain extent. And so I was still a bit tired. But by the end of the day I felt like I was gaining traction on the billing testing again and will be able to finish the route I was working on today.
After work we went to the pool. Megan was feeling a little under the weather so it was just Lucy and Me. We played in the pool for a while and then Megan arrived and we went to eat supper. Lucy ate a single cheeto and then wandered off to play on the playground. As I finished up my supper and Megan took her leave Lucy started walking towards us. Unsure why she was I started walking towards her. She reported she needed to go to the bathroom. Sounds good. I took her straight to the bathroom but after a few seconds on the toilet she reported "no pee and no poops" so I got her dressed and we went out to the pool. Maybe 5 minutes in she let loose some diahrea and made a mess of the pool. I went and washed her off and reported the issue to the pool and they closed the pool for the evening. It looked like they had quiet the challenge cleaning up the mess she made. 
We went home, I felt bad closing the pool like that but I think Lucy learned her lesson this time. To have her precious pool taken from her because of her waiting to long was not a happy experience. 
Hillside is getting new carpet in so the stage is currently disassembled. I'm going to help Derek reassemble said stage wednesday night so I moved games with Ben to last night. We had a pretty good evening. Fought like 4-5 stone golms and harvested a silver vein. Then we realized we really need to get more iron so we left the other silver veing behind and went back to the swamp. That is where we called it a night as I needed to go help Megan clean up for the robot. The house was quite a mess. 
### August 11

Things I'm thankful for


1. A forgiving God
2. A switch in mind set
3. Working from home allowing Megan to rest some.

Thing I love about Megan: 
It is harder right now while she is sick since she basically can't do anything. But I still love her.

Entry

Yesterday was a bad day on the lust front. Before work, before breakfast, I looked at a bunch of lewds. Since Megan was out for the count I kept sneaking back to my personal computer to sneak a peek at more. As usual I pretended like I wasn't seeing pornographic content. I finally came to my sense enough to put it down and get started on breakfast. 
Work wasn't to bad yesterday. I finally got unstuck with a problem in billing testing in the last few minutes of the day. Huzzah!
After work I went out and started playing with Lucy who was sitting and drawing with stencils. I joined her for a bit until she asked for her red marker which I had taken away from her since she refused to put it away a few nights ago. I asked her to ask nicely and she broke down and left the table. Freaking bull headed child. I hope this is not a sign of whats to come.
Megan came down shortly and I went to pickup our farm share. Got a lot of stuff. As I got back my mind set switched into one of "support Megan" which had been starting earlier in the day. This current sickness aside Megan has seemed a little lost as of late. I need to help her recover her mojo. Anyway, in this case it meant loading the dish washer and making supper. She didn't end up wanting anything but some rice so I made up a curry as I went along. It came out pretty good I must say. A little spicy. Then we played some video games since thursday night I expect to be busy with AV stuff at church. Then we went to bed.
During the work day was when the lusting got the worst. I spent maybe 40 minutes looking at porn. I just fully gave in. Despite Lucy taking a nap on the sofa behind me to my great shame. And to top the shame off I spent maybe another 10 minutes that evening looking at porn after Megan had gone up. My biggest lesson here I think is that I need to get something in place on tellurium to slow me down there if nothing else. 
### August 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Ability to help Derek
2. Fun generalsio bots
3. Fast food

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is healing

Entry

Yesterday was a decent day. I helped Melinda with some testing questions, then did some pretty epic work to test out mechanism for auth. I had to setup a python server to act as the auth server and return 502 when queried. Worked pretty well. Finished and cleaned up the billing testing. Then I cleaned up a quick start repo for making generalsio bots for today's T3 time (which went decently well).
After work I immediately left to go help Derek setup the stage at church. We are getting new carpet in so the whole stage was stripped. I kinda thought they might disassemble it to, but that does indeed sound like a pointless thing to do. Unfortunately the carpeting guys were further behind schedule than they hoped because our carpet was being a pain to remove. But we got the stage assembled by about 6:40 and rehearsal went quickly and I was out of there by 7:40ish. I stopped by McDonalds on the way home to grab some supper since I hadn't eaten and Megan liked the sound of some food too. 
We watched CGP Grey's latest video about run ways and then some other random videos on youtube while we ate supper and then Megan threw up and went and showered. She commented after that she felt like today was the first time she felt like she has had the energy to shower. So it's good to hear she is coming back up. I made a first pass at my Living will and Health Care Power of Attorney. That one wasn't to hard. 
Went to bed. Lucy was annoying getting her to bed.
### August 15th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. Proative energy
2. Direction on Lucy's room
3. Fun times playing Ceaser 3 Again

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is just about functional again

Entry

Friday was a pretty good day. Had fun making bots in Generals.io and actually made one that could actually fight. But the end result wasn't particularly specatular. I need to work on it some more. 
After work took the opportunity to have some intimate time with Megan. We generally relaxed in the evening I think. Man, I should really journal more on saturday because I always forget friday evening. Saturday took a bit to get started. I did my chore and various other things till I finally got enough motivation into Megan to come up to Lucy's room and consider options. And then likewise into the garage. I spent the most of the rest of the day then sanding. Lots and lots of sanding. Getting some boards to be ready for Lucy's room. They will need to be finished yet but they are looking and feeling pretty good. That evening I played some Ceaser 3. It's fun coming back to a game that I remember playing basically most of my life. I remember being unable to understand the game and therefore unable to finish the first real mission. And then I remember when I realized how to do things and my ability to play the game exploded. And then a similar store again when I understood exports. I don't know if my knowledge of the game has really improved in the last 10-15 years, but it is never the less still a fun, relaxing game. I never really feel stressed playing C3, but there is always something to do.
Sunday was a bit longer. It was the first sunday back to two services. Despite having rebuilt the stage as well due to new carpeting in the sactuary, everything went pretty smoothly. After church I went home relaxed with some C3, ate lunch, took a nap, etc, until it was time for ultimate. There weren't a lot of us this week. And I felt winded particularly fast. I like to think that means that these regular matches are doing me some good as 3 weeks absent is a notable reduction in capacity. However that is likely attributable to recovering from sickness as well. After ultimate I played C3 again since Skylar wasn't around to play Valheim and aside from that first sunday I've not garnered interest from anyone else. I really need to finish Valheim quick before I loose motivation.
Megan didn't feel like pizza. I suggested pasta and decided to make homemade pasta. However we lacked the eggs. So I decided to go to the store but before doing so we considered some aspects of the week. Planned on lunches and breakfasts, but not suppers unfortunately. No matter. should be fine. With some ingrediants in mind I set off for the store to get enough stuff to get us through the week. It was a pretty quick trip. Then I managed to make pasta, make potato salad, make mayo for potato salad, cook corn and scrap it off the cob, make bread, and clean most of the kitchen. It was a busy evening. I realize that I don't really mind this kinda work as long as I know its coming. So the "single dad" idea while Megan is pregnant shouldn't be to bad. I do like feeling productive. 
### August 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lots and lots of rain. 4.24" to be exact. Wonderful!
2. Nice fresh air all day
3. Quick progress on another billing test.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is up and moving! Huzzah! Sickness is nearly over.

Entry

Yesterday was a pretty good day. I'm feeling energy return to myself as well as Megan, but the day was also very calm and restful since it rained all day long. I was only partially distracted and got a fair bit done. Got the ball rolling on device registration again and answered a bunch of questions for Emily about my billing tests. Then I started making a test for google accounts. This turned out to be very easy as I now have some understanding of what is different and what is the same between the payment systems.
We didn't go to the pool of course. The whole day raining meant the pool was closed and probably very cold. And it was still raining at 5 anyway. We did get the budget closed out at last though. Finally. We were only half way through the month. I wanted to do some reading, specifically of my DevOps book, but Lucy wanted me to read to her so I did. there was only 30 minutes left in the evening, I wasn't going to accomplish anything personally productive in that time so I might as well do some bonding. 
I used up the rest of my 3rd spool of gray filament. Hard to believe I've used 3kg of filament already.
### August 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Achieving the things I set out to do.
2. Little plants a growing. 
3. Progress on my projects at work.

Yesterday I accomplished a few things, but it wasn't a terribly impressive day. I did start work on another route and it is going pretty well thanks to the previous work that I said would eventually help finally helping. Huzzah!
After work I thought we were going to go to the pool, perhaps just Lucy and I, but no such luck. Lucy's swimsuit is still unwashed appearently. I did take Lucy to the playground though. Amanda joined us for 30ish minutes. we had a good time. Lucy rode her tricycle most of the way there and back. I pushed and Lucy did the steering. Steering is what she is having a bigger problem with right now anyway so I was happy to give her some time practicing steering. Before supper though I did some reading. Got through almost the entire 1 hour long chapter I had to get read in my DevOps book. 
After these things we came home and I had a fairly aimless evening. I did end up working a little on home assistant trying to get scenes setup correctly. 
Lucy fell asleep very quickly at bed time, this was not surprising as she didn't have a nap.
### August 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun programming tasks
2. A good job
3. Cool fresh air most of this week.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is flexible and adaptable.

Entry

Yesterday I made slow progress. I started working on a PUT route and any route that writes is more involved than any route that reads. So, it is going slowly. It really robs me of motivation some times when I make such slow progress. 
During the work day my and Drake's AIs fought. I was utterly trounced. EdgeHawk one once. After work I copied down Drake's codebase and started reworking my strategy based on it. It took me a little longer than I had hoped but I eventually got it up and running just in time to switch to playing Valheim with Ben.
Valheim was pretty uneventful. We fought a pair of abonminations and cleared 4 crypts. It was mostly a utilitarian evening. I sailed our long boat back home with all our spoils. 11 stacks of Iron. That should last us basically the rest of the play through. 
Lucy was a whiny mess all evening, except, suprisingly, at bed time. I told her that I would play hide and seek with her until Megan was ready for bed if she let me brush her teeth. And so she did, it went so fast and so easy since she wasn't fighting me. We then played several rounds of hide and seek finishing with Megan helping her find me. That clued her in fairly well to the end of the game. I then put her in her bed but she protested saying she needed "numbers milk" from Megan. Megan informed her there was no milk left but she tried anyway and informed us that she got a little. We are skeptical. The last little strings of breast feeding are still hanging in there it would seem. Hopefully they can be fully and completely done soon. 
### August 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Providing Megan with some idea why she was sick last week.
2. A comfortable chair
3. Working from home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of me now that I'm the one who is sick

Entry

Yesterday I accomplished device registration and then I returned to attempt billing testing. I decided to give up on doing writes and focus on just reads. But then my build broke. Managed to fix it before the end of the day.
After work Lucy and I went to the pool. Unfortunately lightening was spotted the moment our toes touched the water and so we went out and played on the playground hoping they would re-open the pool with enough time for us to have some time in the pool. We got about 12 minutes. I felt bad for Lucy but it was out of my hands. Went home, had supper, went to church for rehearsal and then we played FFXII until bed time. 
I ate a bowl of Cherrios yesterday, appearently they are tainted. We think they are what made Megan sick and made me currently sick. I had diahrea yesterday and continue to today with muscle futigue. We won't be eating any of those cherrios any time soon. 
### August 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fast recovery
2. Donuts at church
3. To be married

Thing I love about Megan: 
She is a loving wife.

Entry

Friday was not a good day. I didn't get much accomplished all day largely because I felt crappy all day. My energy was drained and I was in physical pain as acid burned as I pooped it out. Towards the end of the day I was feeling better, but that didn't help me during work hours. I did manage to accomplish a few things before I decided to call it a day around 4. I just kinda lounged in the evening lacking the energy to do anything much.
Saturday I made chocolate chip oat meal bars for breakfest mostly latching on to the oat meal part of it. I wanted a high fibre diet while my colon recovered. After that I got to mowing the lawn. At one point I thought I broke our mower because it choked to a stop and then I tried pulling it and a felt a click of some sort and the ratch moved while the mower didn't. I then flipped the mower over and ensured the blades could move, clearing the grass that was clogging it. Then the mower would crank but it wouldn't start. I sought advice on the internet as there didn't seem to be much I could do on the mower itself. I tried removing the air filter and beating it out. I figured if I could clear it up some that woud probably be enough to prove whether or not that was the problem. That didn't fix it. I then tried starting the mower with no air filter just to be absolutely sure. It started up. I let it run for just a second to be sure, but didn't want it pulling in lots of grass unfiltered so I turned it off pretty quickly. I pushed it into the grass and went and bought a new air filter. 
I finished the lawn and the entire time I was doing it I felt fine. Mostly at least. I could feel the exhaustion in my heart as I was nearing the end. After I was done I didn't feel so good. Never the less I had some lunch and we headed off to LeMars to meet up with my Mom for Icecream. It was fun, as much as I could focus. I was degrading fast while we were there. I think sitting in the metal chairs was what was doing it. When we got home I did the trimming and felt fine again until I stopped. After that I sat on the sofa and played video games. It seems that focused activity like mowing and triming makes me fine, and perfectly sedintary activity like video games makes me fine, but the inbetween of very light activity made me sick. :shrug:
Sunday was better. I had 2 donuts at church and woke up at a reasonable time. I didn't even need to relieve myself during the whole of the two services. After church I played ultimate. I exhausted easily but it was better than I was epecting. After ultimate I played some ceaser 3 since Skylar is still not back for Valheim yet. I made supper and we watched another Planet Earth episode, this time on the seasonal forests. I do enjoy how the show makes a point of "guys, there's beautiful nature everywhere. Not just in foriegn countries." Played a little more ceaser and went to bed. 
As I was drifting off I was imagining making a modern recreation of the ceaser games mostly so I could have more advanced tools available for certain aspects of the game. To avoid having to do all the details I was imagining isntead of a roman city say the inside of a tron like computer. Instead of houses there are memory banks. Instead of water theres power, instead of comodities there are types of data. It's an interesting idea. But at the end of the day my point is that it's all an analogy, map it as you will. 
### August 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Healthy Basil Plants
2. Pounds of Pesto
3. One conversation down.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a sharp eye.

Entry

Yesterday was a slow start but I got the login events that Mark asked me to do coded up and pushed. A good start to cool down.
After work I was hoping we'd go to the pool since we only have this week and next week left in the season. But Lucy hadn't taken her nap and fell asleep just before supper time so we ended up not going to the pool.
I started making supper and stired and closed up the very full compost hole, I need to dig a new one. After supper I started gathering basil leaves and gathered 18 oz. of leaves. I cleaned them while Megan went to the grocery store to fetch parma for pesto. By 8:50 she was back and by 9:30ish we had finished making 18 packs of pesto, 4.5lb in total. Which is crazy. If we have another harvest that large we'll have enough pesto for one every other week this coming year. 
After supper and before Pesto making though we sat outside across the street and planned what we want to do for garage doors. I think we've settled on long windows with almand coloring. But unfortunately Menards didn't appear to have that. We shall see if we can get some ordered.
Uneventful bedtime. 
### August 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. August Ceaser 3 Mod.
2. Tasty treats
3. A happy Lucy returning. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
A good mom.

Entry

Yesterday I continued cool down. It's just lots of little things right now. 
After work we had supper and I took Lucy to the pool. We played in the shallows, did the lilly pads once, but the most notable activity was we went and hung out on the Lazy river for a little while. Lucy was giggling basically the whole way around. She really enjoyed it. But was very tired when we were done.
After the pool we came home and I got throughly distracted by the Augustus mod for Ceaser 3. It was nice playing the game with a bunch of modern tweaks sorting out a lot of the issues. Most notably of course its nice to have zoom. 
After I managed to bring my self back to attention I started working on a couple little things. I further cleaned out my google keep notes. Trying to get it down to only things that I share with Megan. Almost there. And then I handled a couple other little things before bed. 
We tried doing Star Trek: The Original Series again last night. It was actually working for us this time so we'll probably continue with it. Paramont doesn't have adds on it for some reason. Here's hoping it holds out.
### August 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D printer
2. Wonderful cool evenings
3. Growing little seedlings

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very cuddly like me.

Entry

Cool down week. I continue to run around doing lots of little things. Overall pretty good though.
After work I started fiddling with home assistant and it's scenes. It's been on my docket for a long time, create scenes in home assistant. I created 3 last night, bed time calls, bed time, and over night. These 3 scenes are focused the sequencing of lights around our bed time. Though I want over night to eventually contain a lot more, I want over night to be everything eventually. All doors shut and locked, lights off, devices off or asleep, etc etc. Now, I can do that for the garage doors, but we don't currently have smart locks so that isn't possible. But it was nice to see the progress.
After that I dug a new compost hole and did a quick bonfire and this time I remembered to burn the sensative papers at long last. My desk looks much clearer now. I tried printing another wrench to try to open my sprinkler and it failed again. I give up, I'm buying a new tractor rear end and this time I'll be more careful with it.
Played some Valheim with Ben. Not a lot of interesting stuff going on, searching for more mountains.  
### August 26

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good cycle
2. Another wonderful cool night
3. Time with friends. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves kids

Entry

Yesterday at work I accomplished 3 notable tasks. First got login failures to log into web admin, made my review video, and then helped Melinda with some testing issues. It was a good day.
After work I biked off to Tiahrts for supper and then we walked (I drove and then walked back to them to join them) to Thursdays at the Platz. Lucy enjoy the bounce castle of course and I chatted with Skylar. He commented about one of the videos he watched for catholic training that was basically a CE ad. Not surprising, CE has a fair number of connections to the catholic church at this point.
After that we came home and played video games for video game night. Megan and I passed the controllers back and forth a fair bit as each of us wanted to eat our candy or some such distraction. It was nice keeping the game moving forward while still relaxing. 
Lucy was falling asleep around 9:05, so we decided to try to take her up and put her down. Of course it failed. We watched some lets play of a game "Harvestella" or something like that while we tried to put her down, no luck. We went upstairs at that point since it was 9:35 and continued an evening as normal. Lucy didn't end up falling asleep in her bed, but did fall sleep in Megan's arm's, without any breast feeding, which is acceptable really. If she'll consistnetly fall asleep that we we might work with it. But it doesn't necessarily help with the problem of trying to get Lucy used to sleeping without us so we can have an over night.
### August 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. precaution, specifically checking cell reception at camp grounds before we go there. 
2. New bed time routines
3. Clearing most of my todo list.

Thing I love about Megan: 
encourages me to be adventurous.

Entry

Friday was review. As usual it was enjoyable seeing and hearing what everyone else had been up to. After that I did some PQAs and other odds and ends. It was a pretty quiet day. I was feeling a little tired so I stuck to sitting desk.
Friday evening was also pretty quiet. We decided not to go to the Tiahrts. Lucy was being a whiny mess by the end of the day so I said I'd take her to the pool. We only have this coming week left with it so might as well make the most of it, even if I wasn't terribly excited about this choice. Never the less, Lucy enjoyed it fairly well. 
We got home, had supper, Lucy almost fell asleep on the way home and while I was changing her into her pjs. But after she was changed of course she was bright eyed and bushy tailed. So much for the hopes for an early bed time. Supper also aided in her alertness. After supper I nuckled down and got to the bottom of the bit torrent token issue and got my BTTOLD transferred into BTT. That clears that task which had been sitting on my todo list for months now I think. I tried to also tackle a couple other items to keep my forward momentum. 
Saturday was a small adventure day. We drove to Yankton to check if the signal would be good enough there for work camping, to our great surprise, no. The signal around there was utter crap. Great in Yankton, which was an improvement on republic wireless, but crap anywhere else. Unfortunate. That had seemed like it would be a great option. 
After we got back I continued my efforts to try and get through all my items on my todo list. I stripped the paint off of a side table that we are going to be using in the guest room. I also cleaned up Lucy's new wardrobe and Megan helped me move it up to her room. Lastly I added some structural re-enforcement to my work camping table. I cleaned the garage and called it an evening. The only task I didn't get around to was "Clean Desk." darn. 
Sunday was a pretty chill day. Went to church, I came home during the second service and read Dragon book. Went back for the church bbq/picnic. Went to Ultimate and died in the heat. Played Valheim with Sky and beat the next boss Molder. That went well. Which is good because my interest in Valheim is wanning. Made some supper, watched another episode of Planet Earth. Played some Ceaser 3 and beat my greatest challenge so far for peaceful missions. I think I'll take a break from the game now and pick it up again later. Valentia is notable as a challenge since it is the highest population level of the game. 
Bed time wasn't to bad. We have discovered the counting is the key to get Lucy to go along with anything right now. It started when I started counting while brushing her teeth. Megan caught on and used it to get her to go potty. By the time we had gotten to bed Lucy was a little grumpy but we convinced her to come cuddle with Megan, the new way of putting her down that doesn't involve breast feeding or watching shows. It is working quite well. Though she did come to the bed a couple times through the night. 
### August 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. One more week with the pool
2. Progress on life documents
3. Good conversation with Megan about pregnancy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does want more children eventually.

Entry

Yesterday was quiet. As you might expect from a second week of cool down. I did figure out what was broken with change of passwords from temp to the normal keys in vault. Helped Melinda sort out some test issues. And then I spent the rest of the afternoon on postman, I was trying to see if we could setup automated regression tests that QA is in charge of making and maintaining. It has promise. But I'll need to do some more work to prove it can be done.
After work I walked to the pool by myself and did some lap swimming. There isn't official lap swimming right now, but there is open swim and the pool is overal pretty quiet so I was able to do breast stroke at least (there is a rope across the pool right now so I couldn't do crawl since it doesn't involve diving). After swimming I came home and worked on my will and such. I think we've got most of the details ironed out between myself and Megan. I need to make her documents yet and of course contact all the parties we've listed and verify they are willing to fulfill the roles we are naming them to. I don't anticipate any issues on that latter point. 
After that we had supper and Megan and I had some good conversation around pregnancy. What is making Megan hesitant to persue further guidance and all that. She commented that she likes how things have settled significantly right now, and I understand that. I'll give her some time to recover before I persue the issue again, but I made clear I want what ever we choose to be an active choice not a "woops, never got around to it." sort of thing. 
After that I sat and played Spiritfarer for a while. New game. The tutorial drags on for ages. I want to get to the freedom part of this cute sim game already. Hopefully next time I play I won't have to spend the first half hour of it getting the game to work. 
### August 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lucy who is learning when she should nap
2. A proper interum manager for Delta.
3. Lovely cool nights.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Lets me make stuff.

Entry

Yesterday I took suggestions on what to do. Todd provided some in my update, later I discovered he was now my manager, ergo his suggestions are now commands, that's how that works right? But mostly worked on fixing some of the logic in client api and product catalog to fix linting errors.
After work I was going to go to the pool with Lucy but she opted for the play ground. That we decided we would do after supper, so we waited but then Lucy fell asleep after supper and that put a damper on those plants. She ended up sleeping all the way to bed time.
While she slumbered Megan and I discussed buying or building a bookshelf. We decided to build because there was nothing that was going to fit quite right for what we wanted. So we looked at lumber prices and such. I'm excited, should be fun.
Did a little reading in the dragon book. Took on of the C programs and wrote it up. It didn't compile at first, I had to do some tweaking but I eventually got it and everything worked great. Nice!
### September 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain
2. Tasty food
3. A new Nephew!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Reminds me of things that need to get done. 

Entry

Yesterday I was a little distracted as I did some experiments in computer power. Specifically I setup my work camping arrangement on my desk and measured how much power I consume in a day, ~600w. That is a lot for a off grid battery. I was estimating it would take a decent battery, I was looking at a 293w one and a generator to do off grid proper. The combined cost of 650$. And then about 1/2 gallon of gas per day. Part of me thinks we should have a generator on hand anyway since it is a good readiness item to have. Megan's not yet convinced of the expense yet, and I don't blame her. Perhaps I should start a generator justification list like I did with the 3D printer. But who knows, we might have a camper before we could justify the of grid work camping experience.
Outside of that I helped Melinda with some tests, read about harness, and most enjoyably gave Mark some programming lessons. 
After work I started making pizza sauce. I thought about canning them instead of freezing them, but it just came down to a matter of time. I did not have the time to prepare the sauce and then sterilize and can the jars. So freezing it is again. Maybe next year if I know its coming I'll be able to plan appropriately. 
We made fish on the grill using an herb temple again where the fish sits on a bed of citruis and aromatics. It wasn't quite as good this time as it wasn't quite as smokey. But we still liked the fish.
Played Valheim with Ben last night. Still haven't found Moder or another mountain range even. If I could find a mountain range big enough to have a building in it we could hopefully get an indictor for where Moder is. I ended getting killed by a deathsquitto and then my first attempt to recover my corpse landed me dead by another deathsquitto. The third attemp ben joined me and I got my inventory back. Hopefully next time we are on we can find more mountains and find Moder already. 
### September 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lush lawn
2. Lucy sleeping most of the night in her bed.
3. A weekly family video games night.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes care of Me and Lucy. 

Entry

Yesterday I started the day off helping Cheryl with some testing. Then I started reading about Harness. But half way through the day I was informed I would be doing OpenTelemetry instead. Pivotting to get myself informed about that instead.
After work I mowed the Lawn. I started listening through "Shadow of the Conquer" for a second time. I enjoyed it the first time I'm wondering how much more I'll notice the second time.
After mowing we had supper. Megan and Lucy did some playing and bathing and I read another chapter of DevOps. Then we played FFXII. We didn't start until 8:00 so I think we are just shy of clearing the dungeon we started when we stopped. 
Lucy was falling asleep while we were playing so we got her teeth brushed so she was already for bed. That perked her up of course. *eye roll* but she fell asleep while we were getting ready for bed and stayed in her bed for a while. She started crying maybe an hour or two into the night, but went back to sleep. Later she was more upset and came to our bed that time. Megan and I cuddled her back to sleep and at some point Megan moved her back to her bed. She stayed there the rest of the night. Not a half bad nigth as a result.
### September 5

Things I'm thankful for


1. A new Nephew
2. A 3 day weekend
3. Learning new methods in wood working.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does a good job taking care of Lucy

Entry

Friday at work was mostly about reading up on open telemetry. I've got warm up and one week to attempt to prototype of such. I'm hopeful.
After work we had supper quick and then went to the pool. Unfortunately we were there for only about half an hour before they closed the pool due to poo. Lucy was understandably very upset, we were not terribly happy ourselves. We played on the play ground for a little while to try to ease the disappointment. While there, there was a boy who was not letting Lucy play with one of the slides, he was being generally quite selfish. I tried to ask him to please let lucy pass and told him he wasn't being very nice. But what could I do? I was terrified of actually touching the kid. Eventually Lucy, the kid, and another boy ended up playing a game of chasing each other up and down the slide. Alls well that ends well I guess.
During the day I had made a trip to the lumber yard and bought the lumber I needed to make a bookshelf this weekend. 
When we got home we setup Lucy's new tent, a play tent for the most part, in our back yard while Megan and I tried to take care of the recycling. This ended up not going anywhere as we saw a bat in the shed and were then not terribly keen on being in there. And it was getting dark by that time. 
I forget what I did with the rest of my evening at that point, but it was already pretty late. We cleaned for the robot, a fairly deep clean as I was going to mop the floor in the morning. 
Saturday morning comes and Lucy is stiring as I'm brushing my teeth and sitting upon the porcalin thrown. But I didn't want her down stairs yet as I hadn't mopped the floor yet. I get down stairs and immediately start mopping the floor. I got down on my hands and knees for it this time because I could see the floor was quite dirty in several spots. I had also removed all the instruments from one side of the room in the study because they were all covered in dust and cob webs. After that I went upstairs and got Lucy and brought her down so Megan could have some time to herself in the bed. Then I started on breakfast. I was a bit hurried since I felt how delayed I had gotten between sleeping in and cleaning the floor. It was after 10 by the time breakfast was ready. I checked the recycling center while we were waiting for it to cook and they were closed.
After breakfast I started work on the book shelf. This went fairly well all things considered and I was pleased with my progress, though saddened I didn't get quite as far as I had hoped to get. Happenes. At one point I had to undo some work because things weren't aligned properly and would result in a fair bit of rework on my part later if I didn't attend to them at that point. So I am glad I put in that extra effort to begin with. Though now I'm looking down the problem of percission I have for this morning and wondering exactly how am I going to resolve this. 
We went to the pool again on saturday to have a more ceremonious ending to the year. We played in the lazy river and then in the deep water for a bit. (deep for Lucy that is, 3ft deep). We played there until they blew the final whistle for the year, at least for us. And we headed home, a good end to the year instead of a litteral crappy one. I did a little more work on the book shelf that evening but we soon had supper and after supper Megan cut my hair and we were all exhausted. We got some icecream sandwiches because Megan felt like it and called it an evening. 
Sunday came, I went to church early in the morning for rehearsal. I ran sound. Between services I went home and picked up Megan and Lucy. After the second service we went to my mom's place and got to meet Sam, Brady and Julie's addopted son. It's nice having another child in the family. We had lunch, played for a bit at home. I gave him a pair of eggs and lent him poke'mon Ruby. (I have a pang of regret about that one now because I noticed there was a 116h file on that cartridge that I told him to erase. I don't think it matters to anyone now. It was either mine or Micah's and I don't think Micah cares. But still, all that work for naught!) Then we went to kinderspeiling for a while. Everyone had a blast there, though unfortunately they seem to have a yellowjacket/paper wasp issue. There was on place in particular that we were avoiding due to the presence of a small nest. 
Lucy had a metl down at the park when we demanded she be in a family picture. We just got her back. She then flopped to the ground and kicked and screemed. I eventually got her calmed down enough to put her in the car by telling her I'd let her watch Lucy pictures. Not something we would have done normally but I didn't want to hold everyone up. 
We got home and played with the Brio trains for a little while. That was fun. The set is smaller than I remember. It needs more sidings I think. We wanted to play with the rokenbok but the base station appears to be broken. Sad day. But I think with some soldering and some wires I should be able to fix the traces. I brought it home, we'll see. 
Brady and I chatted about lots of things as you might expect. Ever enjoyable.
After supper Lucy put her self to bed by walking over to the sofa and conking out. It was fairly clear that Sam needed to go to bed too so Brady and Julie struggled through for almost an hour to get him down, eventually he did go down. We then played an enjoyable round of ticket to ride, almost entirely uninterupted. It was nice being free from children for a bit. 
When it was time to go Lucy was still out on the sofa so we just transferred her to her car seat. She woke up for a little but was back to sleep before we were out of Orange city. She woke twice I think on the wya home but went back down. She was still asleep when we pulled into the garage. We managed to keep her basically asleep all the way through bed time. She did wake up some in the middle of the night, notably 5 in the morning, 3 hours early which was about right for some one who had gone to sleep 3 hours early. Overall it was a pretty good night though.
### September 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy's room coming together
2. The new book shelf coming together
3. A 3 day weekend to make great progress

Thing I love about Megan: 
Trusts me even when I do crazy things like tear apart Lucy's room before talking to her. 

Entry

Yesterday was a busy day. I slept in till 8:30ish, which was nice, and would have been nicer if Lucy hadn't been wiggling in our bed through large parts of the night. But I woke well rested non the less due to the sheer length. Lucy and I went down. I got her dressed and got myself breakfast. Sat down to play games since Lucy was alone but decided to journal first. By the time I had finished journaling Megan had come down so I started me day. It was not long into the day before I suggested going to the hardware store having glued things and now waiting for the glue to dry. We did. We picked up the paint for Lucy's room and she had a melt down when we told her she had to put her boots back on if she wanted to stay in the store. Megan took her out and calmed her down while I got everything but the fan that was left to get. Once Lucy was calm Megan brought her back in, we picked out a fan, and were going to go to the register when the same problem caused another melt down. I checked out and used my "20$ off 100$" coupon which I usually don't get to use. Still cost 230$ all included. The fan being half of that.
I wanted to work on the book shelf the most but I needed the glue to be throughly dry before I could sand it so I started working on Lucy's room. This freaked Megan out a little as it started to feel like the whole house was in choas because things were being worked on here and there and everywhere. I attended to some of her smaller concerns like tools on the counter that needed to be oiled and the pile of dishes. That helped. I got one wall of Lucy's room done before supper with the paint that was left over from when we moved in. Then after supper I got a coat on the ceiling and all the appropriate walls. It will clearly need another coat. I never really got back to the book shelf since the glue was taking an eternity to dry solid. I will hopefully get back to it tonight. But I did at the end of the day do some sanding on the board that will be the shelf above Lucy's clothes rod. Then I showered and we decided to get one more round of icecream sandwiches. It was a bit silly I must admit. Went to bed. 
### September 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Painted room coming together
2. Managing to fit everything into the evening
3. Lots of tomatoes

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is getting caught up.

Entry

Yesterday I did some PQAs in the morning and then spent basically the rest of the day fiddling with OpenTelemetry. Specifically I read our tracing and metrics code to try to get an understanding of how things currently work and then I set about trying to recreate such with an OpenTelemetry tracer.
After work I did a few quick things for Megan before I headed upstairs to start painting again. I painted till supper and then finished up afterwards. That is two coats of white done. The room is now ready to have its accent wall painted, which I hope to do tonight. If all goes well we'll be able to put Lucy's room back together tomorrow. Hopefully I'll also be able to finish the book shelf project this weekend and we'll be able to set that up as well.
After painting I took Lucy to the play ground. She's now getting old enough that we can play games. Catch and hide and seek so far. Not yet into the imaginative games, but it's nice that there is something we can both engage in a little. Unfortunately she "waited to long" and so we had to go home. I hope I can use that as leverage to convince her to go potty before we leave the house in the future. 
After we got home and I got her changed I went out to the garage to sand and stain. I opened the garage door and started sanding but these little bugs were attacted to the LED tubes. The bugs were swarming so thick that a couple would fall on my work surface every couple of seconds. I was so bothered by this that I shut the lights off and left the garage door open and sanded in the relative dark for a bit. After a while and I decided I needed light and I shut the doors and turned the lights back on. There were still little bugs but they were much more managable now. I got the glue all sanded down and the book shelf stained. I'll have to double check it tonight to be sure everything looks good before I press forward with the varnishing process.
That took me all the way to 9:30. I went inside and helped clean a little for the robot and then excused myself to go have a quick rinse as painting, playground, and sanding had all left me sweaty. Went to bed.
### September 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Accomplishing lots in my evenings.
2. Progress on OpenTelemetry
3. Lovely weather for the most part (a little hot)

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes care of my sexual needs.

Entry

Yesterday I tried my darndest to get Open Telemetry working. I made it a decent ways and it is indeed a much better system than what we currently have. Or at least a system with less configuration necessary. But I hit a bit of a wall at the end of the day. Hopefully I can get over it this evening.
After work I played "Butterfly Nectur" with Lucy why we put little sock puppet butterflies on our fingers and fly to all the flowers drinking nectur. After that I setup the sprinkler for the lawn, and by extension her. I read the dragon book while I watched her and waited for supper.
After supper Megan and Lucy went to Awana. I cleaned up most of supper and then went up to Lucy's room to start painting. I spent a good while just putting up tape. I tried doing a long bit of tape first but it was clear that such was not going to result in the clean cutting from wall to ceiling. Then I painted the wall and to my disappointement it will indeed need a second coat. So tonight I hope to finish this activity. Then I went to the garage and started varnishing things there. 6 shelves, one book shelf. It will take me I think 4 passes to get everything varnished, which is good because I want to stain and varnish our bedside tables as well. 
After that it was time to play games with Ben. After dying on a tiny island I managed to get to what I believe is the northern most part of the island we found Bonemass on. I did find some mountains there at long last. A rather large mountain range but I have not yet had any luck finding Moder. I'll keep searching next week.
### September 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Finishing the bulk work of painting Lucy's room.
2. Cool days coming where we can have the windows open all day
3. Fun vodogams.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is flexible.

Entry

Yesterday was a little frustrating. I was trying to figure out how to export metric data to telegraf and so far I'm failing. :( Hopefully today I'll get it.
After work I did another coat of purple pink paint on Lucy's Accent wall. With that I think I'm done, just a little bit of touching up here and there to get it all neat. This evening we'll remove all the tape and I'll start putting the base boards back on. Once the base boards are on then we can re-assemble her room.
After that Greg stopped by to look at our garage doors. He had commented that he wasn't sure if the doors or the openers causing problems so he wanted to see them. I was pretty confident it was the doors. One he saw them he agreed. Appearently they don't even make our style of door any more, so they are quite old. He agreed we need new doors. Huzzah! I've been wanting that since we moved in. It will be a very nice improvement.
We had supper and then we were going to play games but Megan had been distracted by my mom's unexpected presence all afternoon so she didn't get the menu made. She did that before we started playing so Lucy and I played two rounds of Mario kart and then we waited a little longer for Megan to finish. Lucy, unsurprisingly, fell asleep while we were playing video games. We had foreseen this and had put her in her PJs and brushed her teeth so she was ready for bed. It was glorious.
Still chipping away at a really really long dungeon in FFXII. 
### September 12

Things I'm thankful for


1. Getting lots done in the weekend
2. Audio books
3. A real challenge in valheim again.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Appreciates what I do.

Entry

Friday I dig into metrics on OpenTelemetry. Not getting anywhere fast. I was stuck on a red herring for a while but after I set that aside I got something done.
After work I did some work on the varnishing and finishing of things. Inching bit by bit towards a completed product. We were going to go to Ribs and Rods but it was rainy and we decided to not. 
Saturday I made chocolate zuchinni cake for breakfast. Megan and I watched half a video on "why the trinity matters" and then I got to work on the sanding and staining of our bedside tables. It took me a while but I disassembled, sanded smooth, and stained all the pieces of our bed side tables. As well as the book shelf. And most notably I cut sanded and glued the backing onto the book shelf. That was basically my whole day. It took the whole freaking day and I mowed the lawn in there. Then we walked to Ribs and Rods at about 6. We were going to go around 5 but Lucy was asleep so we waited a bit and I took a shower.
We then went to ribs and rods and I got a big root beer mug. I get free refills after 7$ anywhere I see the guy if I bring the mug. Not a bad deal. A little pricy but I'll pay for it from my personal going forward. An exciting thing for me at events. Lucy played on the bounce castles for a while, pet the animals in the petting zoo, and had a pony ride. She enjoyed it all and stereotypically did not want to leave.
Sunday was also a busy day. I played a little spirit farer in the morning since I woke up early. 8 o'clock and I woke up Megan. We went to church. I wish I had managed to sleep longer if I had meant I would have stayed awake through the sermon. *eyeroll* After church I went home and worked on varnishing things. I listed to William Craig debate an Atheist, it was enjoyable and I certainly see why people felt that particular debate was an utter knock out for Craig. I managed to just finish everything I had hoped to finish by the time I had to head back to church for a missions team meeting. 
After the missions team meeting we ran home briefly so I could get proper foot wear for playing ultimate. It was a good game if a bit lop sided due to me getting there late and making the teams un-even. But the teams kept shaking up as Kylie came and went and Raleigh decided to sit out less he cause problems for his knee. 
After that Skylar and I played Valheim. We were given a solid run for our money trying to fight off the Fulings. Their villages are quite dangerous places to be. But we managed to get the flax we needed after a good while of effort and retreated to plant it. We then raided another village and like wise retreated with 18 more flax. We turned the latter into weapons to help make future efforts more worth our while. 
After that I made a pizza dough and went out to the garage and worked on the bed side tables. Lesson learned this time is it is best to be patient. Both for the article's sake and my own. I was getting frustrated as the not quite cured hard varnish was choking my sander as I tried to eliminate the grain raise. But I eventually got it all sanded and re-varnished. After that i came in and caned 6 pints and change of salsa. Then I made the pizza. Then we watched a planet earth. And I rounded out my evening with one more trip to the garage for varnishing. I can feel I'm burning myself out with this pace. I should really have calmed down a bit. I'll remember this in the future when I attempt so many things all at once. But I'm reaching the tail end now. And I'm going to pace myself through it. To night I finish the bed side tables. Tomorrow I do the final coat of varnish on the book shelf (and slather one more on my work desk while I'm at it.) Wednesday I'll finish said work book shelf and we'll do a great shuffle in the studay. Thursday I'll do Lucy's fan and hang stuff on the walls.
Didn't sleepy great, not sure why.
### September 13

Things I'm thankful for


1. Projects wrapping up
2. Lucy starting her first night in her bed.
3. Friends for Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Gave me a backrub last night.

Entry

Yesterday was spent all day researching open telemetry. I made a fair bit of progress but I think I have run into a snag. It will be discussed at today's standup.
After work I did a run. Then I started working on the broken rokenbok kit. I took my soldering iron and resoldered the joints that were close and shorted the traces that were further apart to fix them. back on line it came! I let brady know and he said that he bought some more kit just to be sure anyway so we should have two base stations come archer christmas. Nice.
After supper, actually at the tail end of it. Lucy got up and walked over to her desk and was about to fall out of it falling asleep. I finished my supper as Megan took her upstairs and then managed to brush her teeth while she slept and put a pull up on her. Just like that Lucy was ready for bed and in bed. Nice!
I proceeded to reassemble our bed side tables. I'm missing one piece and I forgot to stain the knobs. Megan is interested now though in putting on some porcalin knobs to match the nicer look of the tables so it might not matter. 
After that I sat and played Spirit farer till bed time. We made love. And then we decided to let Lucy start the night in her bed. To accomplish this though I went and got the baby gate from the basement and her light which she had left in the tent. This gave us the confidence to leave our door open and be sure Lucy wouldn't go tumbling down the stairs. But she did end up falling out of her bed in the middle of the night. Poor thing. She spent the rest of the night with us.
### September 14

Things I'm thankful for


1. Projects now rapidly drawing to a close.
2. Cozy bed.
3. Lucy sleeping part of the night in her bed.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is getting back on top of things.

Entry

Yesterday I doubted whether I could accomplish the open telemetry tasks. But after some discussion that seems to have evaporated. I think I've proven that basically everything can be done, except for events. We'll see what people think today.
After work I varnished the book shelf and my work desk. It was the final pass for everything out there. I had to do the bottom of the bookshelf just before bed, but it's done. I'm done staining and varnishing furniture for a while now. After supper I put Lucy's fan up.
Took Lucy to the park with the blue slides, or jolly elementry. Got to make the most of that park while jolly is still there.
Lucy fell asleep before bed time again and we put her down in her room. She slept till about 2:40 there. We'll slowly get her used to it I think.
### September 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My CS books in the study with me.
2. Another project done.
3. Another night with Lucy starting in her bed.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has lots of books.

Entry

Worked on some OT stuff yesterday, I think I feel fairly good about the results at this point. Also did some rework on client API to simplify the auth work flow.
After work I started drilling holes for the new book shelf. Didn't take me to long. About the time it took for Megan to go to the farm and back. I put the shelf in the study and left it to Megan to start shuffling books. I planted the little seedlings, Coriander and Thyme. I planted two of the thyme seedlings in one of the hanging planters, we'll see if I can keep them alive this time. 2 on the north side of the house, 2 on the south. I also planted the Coriander that never really got big. I think maybe the choice of medium was bad. I'm going to try again with seedling starting mix. I also liked the seedling starting mix better for extraction as the mix kinda disolved away from the bottom of the cup making it easy to extract while the dirt, with some clay in it, stuck together but also to the cup making it harder to extract.
After supper Megan started shuffling books and I got Lucy ready for bed. We promissed her mario kart if she got totally ready for bed. I like the idea of encouraging her to get ready for bed right after supper. It seems to be working well to transition her away from a nap and towards just sleeping at night.
I started playing Valheim waiting for Ben to show, but he didn't, then Megan reminded me that Ben was in conneticut. So I set the game aside and worked on the budget. I had hoped Lucy would fall asleep playing mario kart, but she didn't, and eventually we just put on shows for her and she still didn't fall asleep. It was at 9:35 that she finally went down. So we didn't quiet get the evening to our selves, but we got bed time as such. It was pretty nice.
Lucy came to our bed at 2:20 in them morning. The first night, in which she fell out of her bed and hit her head, she slept till 3:30ish. I still haven't go to the extent of putting her back in her bed in her room, but at 3 this morning I moved her to her little bed in our room. I think another week or two and we can remove that bed entirely. 
### September 16 

Things I'm thankful for


1. The opportunity to help Hansons out of SDRS
2. Rain. Lots of lovely rain.
3. Finished budget.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can come in calmly when I'm frustrated with Lucy. (and vice versa)

Entry

Tuesday I when I got back from my morning walk I brought in the mail, which was just a letter to Amanda about SDRS. Laurel was here at that time for a play date for the kiddos. I asked if she had moved their money out of SDRS, she said no, I informed her she'd loose it after 11 years. That got her attention. So I shared with her the details of moving her money out. She said 25k, but I think the number she said is probably half of what it actually is, so hopefully she'll be delightfully surprised to receive 50k.
Yesterday I was fairly distracted. But I did get the green light to engage on Open Telemetry. I also was working on some password stuff for Kevin to better secure our Redis servers.
After work it was threatening to rain, so of course I decided to take a run so that I could encourage the rain to come. It didn't. Just a little drizzel and I even ran the full 3m. So I started the sprinkler. The rain tried to come a couple times but was over all not coming. Lucy was being a pain again as she wanted a shirt with pockets. Such are very rare. But eventually after supper we got out and Megan dropped me off at rehearsal. It was actually raining a fair bit during the drive, but it stopped by the time we got to church. However, it really let loose while I was at rehearsal and Megan was shopping. We ended up with 1.24". Not bad.
After we got home we started working on the budget. Lucy didn't want to eat her candy until it was time for video games, that's new. So I told her we would just get changed into our PJs. We went up stairs and I tried to make it fun by making it a race and Lucy got tangled in her pants and threw her self on the floor screaming and whailing. I tried to calm her down but was getting frustrated myself by this point at her absurd tempertantrums. We got dressed and then I told her we needed to pick out morning close and another tantrum ensued. At one point I slamed the door on her room because she was screaming. It was not going well. Megan came up and handled it from there. 
We didn't get to video games till a fair bit later since we were working on the budget as well. So we didn't make as much progress as I would have hoped. We've now spent I think 3 or 4 weeks in this one dungeon. We've not been able to get a long chunk of time has been part of it. It's also a REALLY long dungeon with 6 boss fights in it. Rough. We are at the door of the final pair of bosses so next week we should be able to polish it off.
Lucy was not sleep at bed time, perhaps candy, most likely her nap in the middle of the after noon, it was a long one. She didn't fall asleep until nearly the end of our episode of star trek at which point I was falling asleep too. She came to our bed at 3. I tried to take her back a while later and the light in her room I think woke her up. Then a while later I tried to put her down in her little bed in our room and my thought on the light waking her up seems less likely since that also woke her up. She demanded a show, I said now, she ran back to our bed. It was a crappy night's sleep. I'm grumpy now, particularly at Lucy.
### September 19th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good camping trip
2. A 3 day week
3. Home automations working magics.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Puts up with me.

Entry

Friday I worked on metrics for the most part all day. I did a very good job if you ask me, but for some reason none of it is showing up in the exporter. Very strange. I'll have to figure it out more later.
After work Megan and Lucy were tired from the butterfly exhibit and so we stayed home instead of going to the Tiahrts. We put all the stuff up on Lucy's walls getting her that much closer to have a completed room.
Saturday morning I made cranberry scones and we watch the second half of the "Does the Trinity Matter video." We weren't fully convinced by it at the end but it was still an interesting video. I then got to work on some meanial things. Ran to the recycling center to see if they were open, confirmed they are just not open on saturdays anymore. Ran to the hardware store and picked up a few things. Put the cloths rod for Lucy's clothes into her room so another piece done. I started cleaning out the recycling in the shed because there was a bat in there. I knew Megan wasn't going to do any recycling as long as there was a bat in there and I couldn't really do anything with the bat until the recycling was at least partially sorted, so I dealt with the recycling. I eventually got foam shot into all the little roosts in our shed to discourage bats. I test fitted a piece of hardware cloth over one of the vents and it fit great. So I'll do that on all the vents soon, but I didn't want to on saturday cause it was going to take a long time and I had books to read. 
Finishe dthe chapater in the Dragon book. Went to book club at 3 with Sky and Issac and chatted about Orson Scott Card for about 2 hours, it was enjoyable. Came home. Had supper. Transcribbed the compiler in the dragon book into my computer and read another chapter of the devops book. 
Sunday was pretty quick. Went to church, did some research about HAM radio during rehearsal and such. After church we went home and packed for our wild camping overnight. We went to the bent bow creek recreation area which had 3 camp sites that one could camp at. They were about a 10-15 minute walk from the car though. We carried everything in on our new wagon. It was quite the adventure. There is an option of taking a trail that has been washed out, which we did, Amanda and I lifting the wagon to carry it the some 20 feet or so. 
After we got camp setup and supper eat, we went for a little walk and examined possibilities. There is the idea of maybe we'll come camp here for several days. In such a case we would probably want a way to aquire fresh water in situ. So we did an experiment hoisting water from the missouri up bucket at a time filling a large 5 gallon bucket. it worked. when we come next time we should be able to do such for fresh water, didn't even have a lot of sand in it.
The over night was a bit unsettling though. We could hear coyotes in several directions and that lead to some shallow sleep. But we were entirely unaccosted as you might expect as the coyotes don't exactly want to come near us. Never the less I was happy Amanda was armed. 
### September 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun camping
2. Anti-itch cream (the need of which is probably the result of the camping)
3. A blow made against the overflowing of recycling in our shed.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can be adventurous. 

Entry

After sleeping through the coyote filled night, we woke up relatively well rested all things considered. Made a fire cooked some breakfast and then took off on a walk. We got distracted by some logs and ended up finding a nice sandy bank that Lucy had tons of fun sliding down. I went swimming in the missouri (skinny dipping to be exact when I was out of the view of Amanda.) it was chilly but not the coldest I've felt. Lucy of course was very very sad when we left. We went back to camp, took a nap, made some lunch. I proposed striking camp at that point so we would be striking camp after we exhuasted our selves with a walk. This ended up being a very good plan because we exhausted our selves striking camp and ended up just leaving at that point, extra walk un-taken. 
We got home and Lucy was very tired from the whole adventure. we transferred our sleeping child from her car seat to her bed and relaxed for a while. After about an hour or so it was clear Lucy was not going to wake and so Megan helped me load the van with all the card board and other overflow recycling so we could at least tamp it down a little. It helped significantly, the shed is now mostly navigable. But there is still a lot of recycling to be sorted. 
After that I went upstairs to wake Lucy. She was still sleepy. She ended up wetting the bed, except at that point she wasn't on the bed, she was on me. So it was nice that we didn't have to change the sheets of the bed. I took my shower at that point. 
I then proceeded to do what I would have normally done on sundays. I did dishes and processed tomatoes. I made 5 jars of diced tomatoes last night, using the food processor. I'm getting better at this canning business. Canning diced tomatoes should give us a fair bit of flexibility to do with it as we please when we use them. I might recommend to Megan we use one sooner than later to know what we are up against. But it would still be nice to figure out what sort of sauce Megan would like so we can make that and have it ready to go instead of needing to take a relatively raw ingrent of purely diced tomatoes to make a sauce on demand.
Lucy went to sleep in our bed and we transferred her at the end of our show. She came back during the night and after an hour or so I transferred her back. She managed to spend the remaining hour and a half or so in her bed. She did wake before I wanted her to though, and I intercepted her before she got to our bed. It screwed with the order of things in my morning though.
### September 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A day with out porn
2. Air conditioning.
3. Time with the Tiahrts

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has good suggestions.

Entry

I cleaned up metrics and get my PR up yesterday. Started working on changes to the OTEL collector we already have deployed to get it to handle the things we need. 
After work Megan was still gone so I went on my run. She was back by the time we got back and had Lucy out picking raspberries to keep her awake. I was not looking forward to Lulu time that night since it was hot. But Megan informed my that Skylar was going to be home alone with the kids so I sent him a message and we arranged to meet at their place. They were watching Bolt when we got there and so we finished the movie, Lucy nearly fell asleep. They then jumped around on couches and such while Sky and I chatted about Chistianity and such.
After we got back Lucy did not fall asleep immediately surprisingly after having been at Tiahrts twice in one day. I read two chapters of DevOps and Lucy fell asleep watching shows. We cleaned for the robot and called it a night.
### September 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. New HVAC going in.
2. Wonderfully cool days during our HVAC upgrade.
3. A short week

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does research

Entry

Yesterday I was a little distracted by the arrival of our new HVAC equipment. Steve's Comfort systems are hard at work setting up our new furnace and chiller. Hopefully it will be done today. It is kinda encouraging when even professionals take time to accomplish something. It's not just that I'm slow some times. Sometimes things take time! Did some work on login failures as well as otel yesterday.
After work I wanted to mow the lawn but Steve's was still here so I took apart a rokenbok truck. It didn't need to be taken apart to fix it, but I wanted to know how it worked on the inside. It was an interesting exploration and I learned quite a bit. Most notably is that the "radio chips" are a lie. They are just bits of dead weight and an LED, all of the important hardware is in the truck itself, including the antenna. 
After supper and Steve's left I mowed the lawn and then I sat and tried to read another chapter of DevOps. Soon enough it was time to play with Ben. I managed to find a guide stone in the ice cave I was in. We now know where Moder is. Huzzah! I tried sailing there and got wrecked. Not huzzah! *sigh*
Bed time cometh. Megan told me she started doing some research on the possible miscariage issues that we were having. It encourages her to go see the doctor in OC, which is great news. Hopefully next month or so we'll be able to make a trip over to OC for such. Hopefully we'll be able to get to the point where we can have a successful pregnancy again. 
### September 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A little Lulu who knows her numbers.
2. A good weekend with family.
3. A reliable car that got us there and back without issue.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Helps me think through lots of things.

Entry

Thursday the 22nd I had a slower day than I had hoped. I got a couple things done but by the end of the day I was spinning my wheels. After work I helped with some supper prep and other administrivia to get us to supper. After supper Megan and Lucy ran to get groceries and I sat down to read some DevOps. I believe I will finish it on time. After that we sat down for some video games and finally beat the tower that we had been stuck on. I really wanted the emotional beats of the story to hit home but I was having a hard time really tracking the story and getting emotional buy in on the characters so it didn't really hit that hard. 
Friday morning was departure time. We got out of the house at 9:34, stopped for coffee at star bucks and realized a few things we forgot. It took us 20 minutes to get through the drive through at star bucks. I'm vetoing coffee from starbucks on the way out of town when the line is that long in the future.
We ended up being third to arrive. Dave and Tonya obviously got there first and Ethan and Loki second. So we sat and chatted with them for a while, me mostly with Ethan, till Kennan and Alaina arrived. And then a while later Julie and Sam arrived. Brady would not arrive until early in the morning due to an inability to get time off from work. I can't remember if it was before Julie or after that Micah and Becca and Haley arrived. Thursday night we had burgers and enjoyed each other's company. Played some stick fight before we hit the sack.
Saturday morning we got out a little before lunch and explored down town still water. It was a cute town. We had a bit of a rough start as we missed our path to get to a stair case to take us down. We went down a dirt trail instead and was dropped by the highway. This wasn't so bad except I had to carry the wagon over said dirt path. We had lunch and generally just roamed around the town. We spent a little while at a realy cute and fun playground for the 3 kiddos. Around 3ish several of the parents decided it was time for child resting. We went back home and played some games and the kids watched a movie. Around 4:45 we loaded up in two vans and headed down to our restraunt for supper. It was kind of funny. I had Megan, Micah, Becca, Haley, Sam, and Lucy in my van, making me the eldest and the driver. Brady had everyone else in his van, making him the youngest and the driver. 
We had to roam a little bit in search of parking, but it wasn't to bad all things considered. It was a nice restraunt but I didn't get to be involved in the conversation before supper very much since I was up walking around keeping Lucy happy. Megan had the same problem after supper was delivered of being unable to eat because she was helping Lucy. 
We got home and play games and drank alcohol. I imbibed heavily because hey, it had to be gone before tomorrow right? I was pretty heavily buzzed but as best I could figure I was not drunk. I was able to follow the floor boards to walk a straight line and could balance on one foot while counting to 30 (probably a very fast counting, but 30 never the less). 
Sunday morning we relaxed and played a little but mostly started packing up since we had to be out of the house at 11. At said time though we went to the playground and enjoyed some time there. Had a lot of good conversation with Brady which was very enjoyable. I don't know why but I feel a little off about some of that conversation. I hope I didn't dominate it to much. 
I feel like I often say something tangental to my main point and people take it to be my main point, or originally it had been my main point but things had morphed. This leads to me talking about something and people poking holes in it in ways I am wholy unionterested in. That might explain some of my off feeling mentioned above.
After lunch we drove home. We stopped by my Mom to hand off some goods from Brady and have supper. We then continued from the pizza shop home. Got home at about 9. I'm not terribly fond of driving.
Lucy slept in her bed till 6:10 this morning! We are less than an hour from declaring it a full night in her bed!
### September 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Our new furnace in place
2. A job in which I get to work from home
3. A pretty good quarter all things considered.

Thing I love about Megan: 
A deep christian thinker.

Entry

Yesterday I didn't get as far as I would have hoped. I got stumped by ansible and had to seek assistance and even then I didn't get all the way through as I waited for firewalls and such to be lifted. After lunch Megan had planned on showering but unsurprisingly our hot water heater's pilot light went out while Steve's was working on the furnace and it's gas supply. I relight the heater and everything was fine. 
After work I lifted weights and we had supper. I spent most of the evening reading. I got through another 2 chapters of dev ops, I should be able to finish it tonight. 
I did a little fiddling around on my computer after reading. I was about to fix some issues with scenes in home assistant when Lucy woke up. She had fallen asleep around 8:30. I went up and rocked her and sang until she was back down, which was at about 9:30. So much for my 15 minutes to fiddle with HA. 
### September 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The case for Christ and the media it has encouraged me to look at.
2. Friends for Lucy to play with 
3. The cool nights not getting so cold as to hurt our plants.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me.

Yesterday at work I didn't get as far as I had hoped. I got really stuck on the ansible work. I need it sorted so I can press on to the otel collector and test running logging information through it. In the afternoon I decided it was nice out os I setup my camping desk outside. It was nice. My laptop lasted about 2 hours. So I must consume ~400w per day is what that tells me.
After work I picked Lucy up from the car, she was asleep where Megan had left her. She was very grumpy and I just let her go back down immedieately. She slept on my lap while I read my devops book. Then we had supper, Lucy had a hard time waking up for it but did get some food into her belly.
After supper we went to the park with the blue slides. We met Tiahrts there. Skylar and I didn't interact very much as he had to keep Penelope occupied. But it was nice having another person to entertain Lucy. Arthie appearently had suddenly decided he was scared of heights. But he gradually got over it and was able to move pretty quick over the bridge. Unsurprisingly by the end of the evening both children did not want to leave. Arthie down right running from Skylar at a point. But eventually we convinced them to give each other a hug (Lucy clearly the height of Arthie now) and they left. Shortly there after Lucy got sad at Arthie's departure and we departed as well. 
Once home I plopped Lucy infront of some shows and went out to the garage. I wanted to make a little step up box for my thursday exercise. The result was less spectacular than I hoped. A lot of my wood split as I screwed the screws in so the box is not as sturdy as I had hoped. Hopefully it will still work fine. 
Then I finished up our will preparation. Just need confirmation from Brady and Julie on being our second choice for Lucy after Megan's Folks. Then we cleaned for the robot. It took quite a while, Lucy had made quite a mess.
The night's slumber was not so great. First Lucy came to our bed at about 2:30. I tried returning her at 4, but she wouldn't stay down. So I brought her back to our bed after singing a few songs. But she was super squermy and stuffy. At 6, unable to sleep well, I retreated to the guest bed room. I got almost an hour of sleep there. Still very tired though.
### September 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. Lots of tomatoes
3. Finishing books

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves taking pictures

Entry

Yesterday was a little slow but I tried to make the most of it. Till the afternoon that is, at which point I was tackling two different tasks at the same time. WOOOOOOOOOOOOO. That was some fast an furious work.
After work I setup the sprinkler and harvested another round of tomatoes. we have 10lbs of tomatoes standing by right now. Tonight we make a pasta dish with one batch of the "diced" tomatoes I made previously. We'll see how we like them and if I should can some more or not. 
After that I sat down and finished the DevOps hand book. I finished Case for Christ that morning so I finished two books on the same day, with only 3 days to spare. Obviously I'm not going to finish the dragon book. I'll roll it over into next quarter as my comp sci book for that quarter. 
Lucy had a rough time waking up and I walked with her and tried to pick raspberries. But she wasn't having any of it. She eventually started feeling better but it wasn't till after supper. Did some random things till it was time for games with Ben. 
After some effort Ben and I finally got a portal to Moder. I died again. And once again the time I decide to bring Ben along everything goes smoothly even before I needed him. But We finally did it. Huzzah! But we quickly realized that as far away as moder is there is no reason to mine for silver near her. So we're going to go silver mining closer to home. 
Lucy spent the whole night in our bed. She's a little sniffly so it helped her sleep better. Deciding not to bother moving her helped us sleep better even if her presence meant we slept worse. Hopefully she'll feel better tonight and we can put her back in her bed. 
### September 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Another sound tech
2. Progress on our video game
3. Excitement for the coming quarter.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is human and gets frustrated with Lucy just as I do. 

Entry

Yesterday I toggled back and forth between OTEL and client api redis. Made bits of progress on both. Still a bit to be done. During Gamelan I took a Ham Radio sample test, scored 75% with basically no studying. That is encouraging for when I finally do the real thing. 
After work I ran 3 miles. I had a big lunch so I wasn't terribly hungry. After supper was praise band rehearsal. We have a new trainee sound tech! Maddi. Huzzah! Derek and I can both have a sunday off. And appearently with her introduction it is now a theoretical possibility to have an all ladies run sunday. Nice.
After rehearsal Megan and I played FFXII. We left of at the final dungeon. We tried beating it but had no luck. After two attempts at the final boss we reverted back to a save before and went in search of spells and such. We are going to do some of the side stuff we never got around to. It will hopefully give us an extra boost for taking on the final boss and get is through the end of the game. Who knows how long that will take though. But it is nice knowing that we are near the end. It's like the point where we had beaten all of the dungeons in BotW and now are just gathering extra strength to take on the final boss. Whenever we feel like the extra benefit provided by the next thing we are seeking is smaller than the amount of effort it will take to aquire it we'll just shrug and go finish the game.
Lucy started in her bed, came to ours around 2. I should have just left at that time. She started kicking me around 6. By the time I had sense enough to leave it was 6:30 and I just rolled my eye and decided to deal with it. but then she kicked me again and I just got up at 6:36 and called it a night. Now I'm grumpy.  
### October 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy's bed when she uses it.
2. SKill in the kitchen
3. Covenant Eyes, both as an employeer and as a service

Thing I love about Megan: 
Puts up with me.

Entry

Friday was another slow day. Lost of banging my head but not a lot of progress.
After work I lifted weights. Megan was late getting back from groceries so we didn't go to Tiahrts. I forget what else happened that evening.
Saturday I made Pumpkin Cranberry Muffins. They were pretty good. It's nice to know that I don't object to pumpkin, just pumpkin pie. After breakfast we loaded up and headed out to Ponca for planning day. I did a lot of speed tests while we were out there to see if we could work camp there. It was mixed results. Some places were great, others less so. I don't know what to make of it. So we are going to just go camp, no work camping. 
Lucy was being a bit of a pain in the neck and we didn't get to review as much as we would have liked. (though the scanning for work camping made that worse.) We did get through most of Megan's review and tried to start mine on the drive home. Without the ability to look at my book it was a challenge. By the end of the evening though we had. After we got home I washed the car so I could have done my weekly chore. Huzzah. And then did random little useful things for the rest of the evening. 
Sunday was nice. Maddi, our new sound tech, is plenty skillful, she just needs to learn Hillside's quirks. After church I swung by walmart to get mason jars, no dice, then we went by Runnings, jars and jar lifter, score. Went home, had lunch, rested. After resting we both worked on our bullet journals for a while till I decided to call it an evening and play some Valheim. I finally got a Lox Tamed and a saddle made. So now I have an excuse to build a lox stable. Considering the deathsqitto situation in my area I ams pecifically going to make it pretty air tight so that dem squittos don't get in and cause BillyBison to trample the stable to bits while trying to kill the attacking mosquitto. 
It was a busy evening in the kitchen last night. Unfortunately I miss planned my evening. After I made the pizza dough I started on the tomatoes and that locked up both my burners for a long time leaving me without a burner to work on for pizza topings. woops. I really wonder if things would have gone better if I had gone down stairs and gotten the induction burner. But in the end things started coming together and I finished most of it around the same time. We got started with our movie around 7:40. Lucy was a pain in many body parts during the show, which was only an hour long, if that. She kept yelling and jumping on everything. It was starting to piss Megan and I off.  
After the final episode of Planet Earth we relaxed for a little, played a bit of Valheim, and then we went for a walk. We started practicing "Stop" with Lucy. This came about because on Saturday she ran off from us down the trail. A trail we knew wasn't the safest place to be and could involve her falling down tens to a hundred feet of enbankment into the missouri. When she ran away from us we were understandably upset with her. So we later in the day started playing "Stop" where she would run ahead and if we yelled "stop" she would stop, and then we'd yell "go" and she would go. It worked well enough to turn the discipline into a game. If she got really excited she'd still forget to stop at first. But it was certainly progress. Her primary comment when we asked her why she wasn't stoppping before we started playing this game was "Some times it's hard to remember." so hopefully this will help her remember.
Slept in her bed till about 2. Then I returned her to her bed at about 5, and then 20ish minutes later she returned. It wasn't the greatest night. I'm grumpy.
### October 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good start to the quarter
2. Progress on metrics yesterday
3. Lovely weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Allows me to sneak treats.

Entry

Yesterday I made some decent progress. I thought I would be stuck most of the day but it turns out that that wasn't an issue. Primarily because I spent the whole day finishing up the work I had started for incorporating metrics external to metrics.ts into otel. I finished up close to the end of the day. 
After work I did a short run. Made record time I think on that run, but not by much. Then we had supper, I biked to the Gutzmans to pickup a book on Catholasism, and then spent the rest of the evening working on my bullet journal. I managed to get it finished and printed yesterday. This evening I will bind it to the rest of my journal and my quarter will officially start.
### October 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A completed bullet journal
2. A good company to work for
3. Great weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty food

Entry

More fixes on my PR from Justin and Emily. All employee meeting, Jeff Wofford our VP of Technology is departing. But all in all an ok day at work.
After work I lifted weights, continued work on my bullet journal. We had supper, or tried to. Lucy fell asleep and was having a hard time waking up. It was nice that she had a good time at Tiahrts though. We managed to get her to wake up enough to eat a little bit of food before we went back to Tiahrts while Sabrina was at Bible study. Lucy was good about leaving this time which was nice.
After Tiahrts I mostly worked on my bullet journal. I had to redo one of the sheets as I spotted some errors. I then did the binding on it which took about 45ish minutes. That means I can do 1 folio every 15 minutes. I estimated that If I were to include all of my journaling here at the end of my journal this coming year it would add 25 folios. That would take me some hours to bind all of it. So we'll see about that one. 
After I finished my journal there wasn't really enough time to enjoy some video games, even though I had the coins. So I setup a profile for Lucy on Plex. I'll setup one for Megan as well soon. It's kinda neat. I think we will enjoy having this feature. We may share with Megan's family, but not until I do the great server shuffling I think.
Lucy slept very little in her bed last night. It wasn't a very good night. 
### October 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chance to chat with Jeff Wofford
2. A new quarter starting up.
3. A game night with Megan.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very sexy.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. I made some notable progress and realized that if everything goes as planned in the next day or so I may be in very very good standing for my pitch this cycle. We shall see. I need an ansible script to be run now and it is breaking so I'm a little stuck until I can get Steve's assistance. 
After work I went out and picked tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and raspberries with Lucy and setup the sprinkler. This might actually be the last time of this year I water the lawn. Fall is here. The grass is not going to be growing quite so much from here out.
After supper Megan took Lucy to Cubbies and we sat down to play "Factory Funner" which was great. And even though we were just learning it we managed to get a full play through in. In two weeks we'll probably be able to get two play throughs done.
After that Megan went to church to pick up Lucy and I finished "Interstellar" so we could delet it from our plex server. Trying to get more in line with the law, remove any pirated material. Also Interstellar was huge, like 24gb. 
Played some Valheim with Ben. We beat Moder so we don't have any further major need for Silver. We need to start setting up a base camp in the plains. We did some initial exploring last week and got some of what we need. But one of the most important things is going to be flax. Which we managed to snag some of but since we can't grow flax in the meadows we'll have to setup a forward base to grow it. That will be next week.
Lucy was fairly average last night, at least for getting ready for bed. She didn't fall asleep until after our show was done so we watch a Tom Scott video about treadmill cranes and she was out. Gave us the opportunity for some intimacy before bed.
Recently I seem to be sleeping more deeply as I don't tend to notice Lucy's arrival until she has been in our bed for some time. Perhaps I'm adjusting to her presence. :shrug: 
This morning I had a chat with Jeff Wofford. It was probably one of the best interviews I've had so far. He is such a profoundly good programmer that I can feel a lot of wisedom in his words. And he seems to be the most in the direction I want to aim so far. Thus far I've met people who've been good programmers but haven't had the same pasion for coding that I have had. I want to be good. I want to be great. I want to be a masterful programmer. The most interesting piece of advice he gave was "teach". That when he had to teach programming it was what helped him become great at what he does. We'll see about that one. I don't disagree with it but I'm not sure how to act on it. Perhaps teaching some classes for USD, perhaps more blogging, perhaps I should see if I can help with either of the robotics clubs here in town. 
### October 7th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. It not freezing last night
2. Reassurance that I'm reading the right books
3. A cute little girl

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has lots of creative solutions for raising Lucy.

Entry

I fumbled around and made relatively little progress, mostly because I'm waiting on Steve to help me with some Ansible stuff. But the most interesting part of yesterday was the chat with Jeff Wofford.
It was one of the most unique chats I have had thus far. I think primarily because it felt like he actually had some idea of what to answer to "What's next?" Most people could only kind of mention how they got to where they are, not entirely sure themselves. But Jeff mentioned how he looks back and can feel how certain things dramatically improved his ability. Teaching and Gamejams being the two most prominant. I don't know how I'll be able to do the former, but the latter is definatley an option. I may try to see if I can get connected with the local robotics clubs here in Vermillion. Teaching young children the fundamentals of programming will be VERY hard and will force me to have a very solid understanding of it. I may also throw out some feelers to Tom and ask what sorts of things would I need to do to be able to teach a collegiate level course at the university or even a masters level course. But, one of the most encouraging things about the conversation is when I held up the "Dragon" book and he greatly approved. He also recommended "Design Patterns" which Tom also recommended. Both of these books recommened by both of these men is a very strong argument. I think they are the best target for me to aim at currently, so if they say it's a good choice I'm inclined to agree.
After work I ran. In my physical earlier in the day the Doctor told me I should really get cardiovascular exercise 4 times in a week, and 30m each time. Ultimate covers that well enough. Running the 5k does as well, but my shorter run does not. So I'm probably going to abandon my shorter run. That being said I did clock in at 29:20 yesterday for my 3.07m run. If I keep improving I may have to increase my run. I can't believe I'm already to the point where a 5k isn't enough. 
After running we prepared supper and I went off to rehearsal. I brought the Dragon book of course. I'm going to conquer that book this quarter. After rehearsal we covered our plants outside since last night there was a chance of frost. We got down to 35f, which was nice to hear. Tonight though we are supposed to get to 27f which will definitely be a frost. Hopefully the bed sheets will allow the plants to pull through and we'll get 10 more days of harvest. 
Then we played some FFXII. We gathered a couple of useful things and have made general progress towards our objectives. Most notably we got "Protectga" that will be hugely beneficial. I would like to get shellga but it looks like it is going to be an utter pain in the neck. We'll see, it may still be worth it. But we have already gotten a number of things that will be hugely beneficial, like "Arise".
### October 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An imune system
2. Most of the night Lucy free
3. The turning seasons

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes Lucy to fun events with friends.

Entry

Friday I made some progress. But was once again stumped by access to things. Hopefully I can get the access I need to figure out what is wrong today.
After work I did an experiment while I lifted weights. My mats came but they were 3/8ths inch when I thought I had ordered 3/4ths inch. So before I opened them I took Lucy's foam squares down stairs and tried them both single layer, 3/8ths, and double layer, 3/4ths. I didn't really notice a difference so I decided that means it didn't really matter if it was 3/8ths or 3/4ths. And, if I really want that extra pad latter, I can always order another set. So I decided on 3/8ths inch foam squares.
After exercising I forget what I did. probably not terribly important. I think I tried reading the dragon book mostly. I recall extracting pumpkin from a pumpkin. 
Saturday comes. I make pumpkin scones. It was a relatively quiet day really. I did some reading. I got setup to work go through the whole list of HAM Technician questions, made it through 56 on saturday. I hope to finish the rest this week. I also replaced a window well cover that had broken from I think me stepping on it. Removed the plants that were growing in the well, or at least I thought were. Turns out all the plantlife I saw was from just under the edge of the cover and growing in the garden proper. I sprayed around the edge of the window, hopefully that will impeede further growth there. 
Did some reading of the dragon book as well. I really want to finish it this quarter. Also worked on the budget. We are still 5 days from being as late as last month, but we made progress.
Sunday I ran sound. I felt bad falling asleep through both of pastor dan's sermons. But I'm feeling sick so I was a bit tired. I did still play ultimate because I was feeling better by that time of day. Played some Valheim with Skylar. Got to ride my Lox around a bit before it got killed. That wasn't to surprising really. Deathsquittos mostly. 
After games I made pizza, proccessed tomatoes, did my normal sunday stuff. We are closing in on winter now so there will be less for me to do in the near future. One last batch of diced tomatoes last night. Any more tomates will be saved to make tomatoe paste at this point. 
We watched "Abstract: Architecture" a design show that this particular episode was about architecture. It was fun but it had profanity in it so unfortunately not something we'll be able to allow Lucy to watch or we'll watch more of at this point.
We went on a short walk before bed. Walked by the house that had a chestnut tree and picked up a bunch. We'll try cooking them up and see if we like them. Lucy scrapped her knee when we were on the sidewalk just in front of our house. As a result she was a wigglewart all the way to lights out. She didn't want to sleep in the middle of the bed so she retreated to her room and cried in her bed. I went to comfort her and ended up laying there with her for about 2 minutes until she was calmed down enough to come to our bed again. So we started the night with her in our bed. A little after midnight I removed her to her own bed. She stayed there all night. This was technically not the first time she finished a night in her bed, as there was one other night that I had bearly woken up when she also woke up and I took her down. But this morning she stayed in bed until 7:50 when I came to wake her and get her dressed. Encouraging! Hopefully in the next few days we'll be able to get our first night without Lucy. 
### October 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Ambition
2. Quiet mornings
3. 7 years of Marriage

Thing I love about Megan: 
Still married to me.

Entry

Yesterday I finaly got the software "Lens" that Steve had told me about and I was able to connect and look at the clusters at last. This provides me the ability to look at logs and such, which is a great improvement. 
After work I was feeling some of the sickness so I ran only the 20m run instead of the 30m run. Then I worked on some HAM radio questions. Up to 100 examined now, most have been just raw memorization to me dismay. We had supper. Finished the budget. Then I tried to do some sensor projects. I tried the heart sensor and the flame sensor. I get the heart sensor to spit out some information, but there was some serious noise from somewhere and I was unable to get useful information. The flame sensor seemed totally shot, didn't get anything out of it. 
Through out the afternoon and evening I was printing a death star ice ball mold. I'll be giving it to Kennan for his Christmas present along with a couple other dodads and a book on cocktails. 
Lucy started in our bed, ended in our bed. It wasn't a great night.
### October 12

Things I'm thankful for


1. My phone having data again
2. Half the ham radio questions categorized
3. One more warm day yesterday

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is ever resourceful 

Entry

Yesterday was kind of fun. After a bit of banging my head I did finally get metrics to start coming through to grafana! huzzah! progress.
After work I decided not to exercise since I was still feeling a bit ill. We made supper and harvested 6.4 oz of rasperries. Hopefully we can get a few more good harvests before the end of the year, which looks to be next monday night at 26f. Then Lucy and I went to Jolly to play with Tiahrts for Papa time again. It was good. The evening ended when the wind suddenly picked up quite dramatically and we feared it might rain on us. There was this funny moment right after we had started going our own ways that I could hear Skylar arguing with Arthie and heard him say "They are already to far away." We were like 100 feet away, so I kept walking, another 70 feet or so I turn back and Arthie was where I had been just a moment ago. So we stopped and went back and he caught up with us. I struggled to understand what he was saying but eventually figured out "I wanted to give Lucy a kiss but you kept walking away from me." Lucy was at this point pouting on her tricycle as she had had two bumps recently. She sat passively as Arthie gave her a little peck on the cheek and then he ran back to Sky and we went our separate ways.
At home I started working on ham radio questions. I got through about 50 when I was running out of steam, then I hit the basic electronics questions and blew through another 50 with out much hesitation. It was nice to get to things I knew so well. That puts me at a little under half the questions categorized. Hopefully I'm also out of the woods as goes regulation questions. 
We then cleaned up for the robot and went on a walk during which Lucy spent half of it on her bike, and the other half whining and screaming since she said she wanted to stop and take a rest regularly and Megan and I wanted to keep moving. It was exhausting.
### October 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy sleeping after supper giving us some time to our selves.
2. Working from home
3. Our upcoming trip to the pregnancy specialist.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks very deeply

Entry

Yesterday I was trying to get on to the next steps of the metrics project. It's coming together, right now I need to get the "environment" tag working correctly. But it is very hopeful. I completed the migration for billing to the new metrics and pushed a PR for it. Hopefully that will get merged today and that will provide the confidence to make a scaffolder update on monday.
After work Lucy was a screaming whailing mess and so I went upstairs to comfort her. I managed to get her to switch tracks by saying we should play mario kart. That helped her get out of her funk. She then helped Megan make supper. I ordered my new phone, a pixel 6, and a couple other things. I'm working on setting up the server rack in the basement and one of the next steps for that is the PoE switch I have coming now. That and the patch panel will be the first things I put in. I kinda hope I'll be able to get to it this weekend, we'll see. 
Lucy was falling asleep at supper time, we managed to get some chicken into her and then I took her up to her bed and got a pull up on her. Megan and I finished supper and then relaxed a little before having some time to our selves. 
Played Valheim with Ben. The majority of the evening was spent on the task of setting up a forward base. We just finished by the end of the evening. Next week we go in search of flax and black metal. Even more important than the black metal is the flax honestly. Fortunately that we can teleport back. We'll probably also swing by the near by mountains for some silver for a few bits and bobs. 
Lucy woke up a little before bed time. And as expected she didn't go back down until a while after we were in bed. Then she came back, she laid between us and around 4 in the morning I took her back to her bed because she was lying in ours kicking me. Fortunately she slept the rest of the night there. 
### October 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A 3 day weekend
2. A lovely wife
3. A little Lulu growing up big and strong.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Play video games.

Entry

Work didn't go quite as well as I would have liked. But I did accomplish the important things. Stuff is showing up now in grafana with the correct environment tagged. I can start working on dashboards. It's very good. I just wished I could have more confidence about my ability to make said dashboards. I also didn't accomplish very much with the client api redis password migration. I felt like I spun my wheel all day on that one.
My mom came for Gamelan and stayed a few hours after to play with Lucy. Always nice to have her around for a bit.
Evening came and I was a little mentally worn out, I wanted to sit and relax with something but then I realized it was thursday and I should run. Which actually wasn't as bad as it sounded after I thought about it. My brain could check out and I'd listen to an audio book while my body did it's best to move and find it's weak spots. Turns out my course is just shy of a 5k, by like 60 meters, I'm still going to call it a 5k, or at least 3m run. Did it in less than 30m even with a few minutes walking period part way through. Appearently my top speed was almost 12mph and my first mile was 8:25. Not bad. 
After I got home I mucked around a bit dealing with little things. We had been planning to go camping this weekend but between sickness and it being much colder and windier than anticipated we scrapped those plans. So we had our ramen noodles that we planned on and then sat down a little early for video games. We unfortunately did not make it as far as I had hoped. I wanted to be done with the Lhusu mines but we bearly got to them by the time it was time to go to bed. We managed to get through the first phase, beating the Antlion. Fortunately it is a 3 day weekend so we plan to finish our efforts today and try to finish the game today.
### October 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A 3 day weekend
2. The end of the growing season
3. Lucy spending her first full night in bed!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is empathetic to my sexual needs.

Entry

Friday was fun. But we spent a lot more time playing FFXII than anticipated. We had a very casual morning lying around and slowing waking up. We didn't eat lunch till about 2:30 and then started playing Video games around 3. We did end up beating FFXII but it took basically the rest of the day. It was a depressingly mediocre game. FFIV and FFVI still hold such deep places in my heart, partly because of the age I was when I played them I'll admit. But the games meant so much to me yet this game and it's music will be rapidly forgotten. Sad.
Saturday came and I made apple cinnamon coffee cake. We mostly did prep work for winter. The cold is coming! I chatted with Nathan while I cleaned the rear porch. We had a good chat about nothing in particular to much. I tried to avoid making it all about his love life but got a few tidbits. It was a good chat. 
After the porch Megan went to the library book sale and I did some work in the garage preparing for winter and shampooed the porch rugs. Then we harvested all our tomatoes and tore down the plants as a hard frost is coming, inevitably. We forecast for like 17f tomorrow night.
The worst part of the day was Lucy and her accidents. She waited to long 3 times by the time we left for the praise team potluck. Then she had an accident at the Wirggins, I was not happy, and then she had a 5th one after we got home and was changed into her pull up. We were beside ourselves. What on ear was going on with Lucy? It was quite depressing. Lucy also was throwing fits about doing or not doing things. She has been very difficult lately.
Sunday came and I slept in till 8 since I wasn't running sound. With it being harvest season Derek is pretty busy this time of year so I've been doing most of the sundays in October. We told Lucy that she wouldn't get to stay for Sunday school if she waited to long, and to her credit she didn't. She went potty before the service and once during. Better. She managed to go the whole day infact without an accident so she got a sticker at the end of the day. After church though when it was time for rest time she had a complete melt down. She threw a fit for a solid 20 minutes while Megan sat calmly with her and tried to keep her from hurting herself or her room to much. Eventually she calmed down and laid down with Megan and they read some books. I left for Ultimate.
Ultimate Frisbee ended up being Ultimate handball. It was way way to windy for a disk. But since we weren't in a gym rolling or dribbling the hand ball was not going to be a good plan. So we played by ultimate frisbee rules. It was fun. My ears got cold. Got home and played Valheim for a little while. Skylar eventually joined and set out for a sailing adventure. Where we are now primarily what we need to do is discover the location of the next boss. We are not having much luck. 
I made pizza, an apple cake, and did a bunch of other prep work for this week. I expect the amount of stuff I'll be doing will trim down in the coming weeks since we don't have as much work to do for processing food and such left at this point. Pesto is made, tomatoes diced and canned. I'm going to take a break from the apple pizza for a bit. I've not been having much success. 
Watched Finding Nemo.
### October 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My new google free phone
2. A new furnace to fight of the 16f night last night
3. Lucy dressing herself in the morning.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is supportive of my slightly ridiculous privacy experiments.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. I spent the whole day working on grafana dashboards. I had to make a couple tweaks to various things to get it to work like how we had done it previously. Some of these we may not keep in an endeavour to move towards a more flexible system. But it was overall decent progress.
My new phone arrived in the morning. I wanted to flash it from my work laptop but that was a no go as my laptop is appropriately locked down by CE. So I had to wait until the end of the day. And then I did my exercise before I turned to flashing my phone. I'll admit it was a bit scary, my brand new 380$ phone and I was voiding the warranty. But everything flashed just fine and I decided not to include "MicroG" an opensource reimplementation of the google play services. I'm not entirely certain I will stick with this but it is worth a try. So far the only hard no has been Libby, so I may have to just record audio books off of my old phone to get libby books in the future. I'll also try a browser based usage.
Lucy slept in and dressed her self entirely yesterday morning. That was good. Sleeping in maybe not, we'll see.
### October 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. New phone going strong
2. My ridiculous rack mounting ideas bringing me joy
3. A quiet morning and afternoon

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a sexy lady.

Entry

Yesterday was a fair bit of rework as I attempted to accomidate the objectives Justin pointed out. I was able to accomidate it just fine with a little work and found a couple of things that needed to be tweaked. a PR is up for that now and I'm waiting on it being merged.
After work I went down and lifted weights. Megan didn't get home till around 6:05, so right when she got home Lucy and I turned around and left for Tiahrts. Chatted with Sky a bit while Lucy and Arthie played. They even made the ridiculous decission to play outside for a while, it was 38f! Eventually Lucy had enough of the cold and came inside. They watched an episode of paw patrol and we left.
Once home we had supper. I went up to read while Lucy watched shows. Lucy had an accident. Megan cleaned that up and then Lucy went back to shows while Megan and I had a little time to our selves. It was nice since it had been almost a week. It's good to have something relieave presure in me a bit as the urge to sin by looking at porn has been getting strong this last day or so.
I continued to read till it was time to clean for the robot. Then I remembered we hadn't spread the tomatoes yes so I went down stairs and did that while Megan cleaned. As we were getting ready for bed Lucy had another accident down stairs. I forced her to clean it up. Then we tried to get ready for bed but she wasn't listening. Specifically she was actively ignoring us, putting her hands on her ears and singing. So we dressed her and brushed her teeth by force which she did not like. Hopefully it will eventually sink in that while Megan and I are overall leniant parents, we do expect her to follow direct orders as such. It took her probably 10ish minutes to calm down to the point where she'd accept comfort, and then another 10-15 till we could watch our show.
Lucy would not stay in her bed last night. Twice I carried her to her bed, and within 5 minutes she came back to ours. It was a rough night.
### October 20

Things I'm thankful for


1. A time to play games with Megan
2. Another pure day
3. Pancakes

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys playing board games

Entry

Yesterday was slower than I would have liked, but other people have other priorities and I was stuck waiting for a PQA. It got rolling by the end of the day though, that's good.
After work we loaded up and went to the Lions club's pancake dinner fundraiser. That was enjoyable. Then we took Lucy to Awana and Megan and I stayed home and played "Factory Funner" again so that we'd have a little more experience before Archer Christmas. It was quite enjoyable. I look forward to playing said game with more people. 
After the game I went and picked Lucy up from Awana giving Megan a break from driving Lucy around. Something we plan on doing consistently in the future, Megan drops her off, I pick her up (or viceversa). Then it was time to play games with Ben. We did some raiding ona near by fulling village and by the end of the evening we had some 33 flax planted. Next week we will hopefully get to the point where we can harvest flax and actually have production. 
Lucy wasn't to bad at bed time but she was wide wide awake all the way through the show. She fell asleep probably after Megan and myself. She was so squirmy. I moved her to her bed at about 1 in the morning. She did end up staying there the rest of the night, that was a nice surprise. 
### October 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. All my automation stuff
2. One more spat of warm weather
3. Working from home where my sleepiness won't really matter.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty food.

Entry

Yesterday did not go as well as I had hoped. The billing metrics branch got merged and I started getting metrics. But then they started to disappear a little after two, which was very strange. And then the metrics I was getting weren't making any sense. They didn't seem to be at all related to what we were currently getting in our existing metrics system. I've got today left to try to make sense of it.
After work I ran, 3.10 miles in 28:50. I am getting faster. Ha, just in time for it to be to cold to run.
Hung out a little after the run until it was time to depart for rehearsal. That went fairly well. Returned and we had supper. I sat and chatted with my mom most of the evening. Shared with her all the home automation things I have been doing. 
Lucy fell asleep before the end of our show. But she returned to our bed twice last night. It was not a great night's sleep since she kept poking and kicking. I'm quite tired now.
### October 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good weekend
2. Cool weather returning
3. Sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a very sexy lady

Entry

Friday did not go as well as I had hoped. The seamonsters came out right at the end and made me trip and fall flat on my face attempting to finish the pitch.
After work I did my weight lifting, but I was feeling really tired so only got through 3 of 5 exercises. We were all feeling tired so we ended up playing some video games in the evening. Started "Skyward Sword" which seems like it will be quite enjoyable but definitely has a much more traditional Zelda feel to it than BotW. We had wanted to play more but Lucy was throwing a fit and waited to long and was being a pain about cleaning it up. 
Saturday came and I made some more pumpkin scones for breakfast. I screwed up the receipe as I made it and that resulted in it taking a little longer than I had hoped. Megan and Lucy went to the Ddays parade, I stayed home and mopped the floors and took the trash to the dump. Then we headed out to Sioux Falls for lunch and to meet up with my Mom. About 15 minutes out Lucy suddenly decided she was very unhappy. She screamed the remainder of the 15 minutes and then screamed and ran away in the parking lot. I chased after her and she ran behind the building and sat and cried. It was a while till we actually got to lunch and then she still refused to put her shoes on. We eventually gave up on that front.
Then we went a little south out of Sioux Falls to an orchard in Harrisburg and let Lucy run wild for a while. She had lots of fun. We had really hoped maybe she would fall asleep on the way home or shortly after we got home, but we had no such luck. She was a grump regularly as a result. It was not a pleasant evening in that regard. But the game was enjoyable. 
Sunday was short as usual. After church I reset my phone and this time spun it up with Micro G. Everything is working significantly better now. Some apps that wouldn't even open now are working great. I'm a little saddened by this incursion of google but at least my phone is still running opensource software on that front. 
Played Ultimate Handball, played some valheim. I was getting tired of not having any luck finding a guide stone so I looked up some guidance. We finally found a guide stone and now are on our way to Yugloth, next week. 
I grilled a pizza for supper. That was fun. The best part was counting down the seconds while the pizza finished and a thunderstorm threatened to roll in. I was feeling rain drops, and hearing them sizzle on the grill, when I decided "good enough!" and snatched the pizza off the grill and we headed inside. We watched "My Neighbor Totoro" last night. Lucy's first time through the movie. She was intranced most of the time. I'm glad she liked it.
### October 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Patience
2. Frosting
3. Cuddles

Thing I love about Megan: 
Gives me her sex.

Entry

I'm getting a little depressed with OTEL. I feel like I am not making any progress on the project and I fear that after 6-8 works of effort we are going to have to scrap it. I don't know what's going on and I don't really know how to solve it.
After work I ran. My new phone needs to work on it's position tracking a little. It was a little rough for a run, had me going through houses and such. 
After supper I settled down to try to hammer out more HAM radio questions. I'm taking practice tests regularly and I am regularly getting into 30 questions answered correctly which is a nice buffer on the 28 I believe I need. I'd like to get up to 33 at least though, only 2 mistakes. I've got 30 questions left to categorize and then I'll be ready to tackle them in flash card form I believe. 
I was having a really rough go of it last night trying to not give into lust. I really need to get a Linux client for CE. 
Lucy was refusing to put her supper dishes away and then went potty and was refusing to put her bottoms on. Rather than spending the whole evening doing something fun she instead spent the whole evening screaming and throwing a tantrum on the floor. I came and relieaved Megan from the screaming child post and she took her shower. at about 9:05 Lucy calmed down enough to play a game to get into her PJs. We then watched some Bluey until bed time. She fell asleep promptly at bed time and we enjoyed the majority of our show without her. Had sex, went to bed. Lucy came to our bed twice and the final time she stayed till morning.
### October 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Some level of restraint.
2. Completing my HAM radio questions
3. A chance to play some star craft before we have team fights on Thursday.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes fun costumes for Lucy and myself.

Entry

Yesterday I spent a decent amount of time working on my review video. I was also throughly distracted by lustful thoughts that delayed me significantly. It has been a rough 2 days trying to avoid elicit imagry. 
After work I checked if Tiahrts wanted to go to the park tonight. But they were busy so it was just Lucy and me after supper. Between that and supper I finished categorizing the HAM radio questions and made a script for running flash card drills on them. Nice. Anyway, at the play ground we ran around played some with a ball that had been left outside. At one point Lucy slide down the slide and some how gave herself a bloody nose. I missed the incident and because of the low light I didn't notice she was injured (as she had stopped crying after a minute or two) until we were over in better light getting ready to head home. We watched an episode of MLP to get Lucy more interested in it. Netflix only has through season 4 now! Shame!
We are currently watching through Star Trek: The Original Series. We are getting to the point now where they are finding a groove. The episodes are not quite as dull, and even have points of genuine interest. 
Lucy came to our bed I think 3 times last night. And the cat was meowing early in the morning. The little ones are out to ruin my sleep.
### October 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My enderman costume
2. A fun review video
3. Lucy falling asleep during our bedtime shows again.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes fun costumes for us all (or ressurects in my case)

Entry

Yesterday I spent the morning finishing my review video. I went a little overboard I'll admit, but it was a good creative stress reliever over the mysterious problems that have sprung up here at the end. Then I struggled with queries for the rest of the day.
After work we eat supper and got ready to go to the pumpkin carnival at church for Awana. Lucy went dresse das a raspberry, Megan went dressed as "Mum" or "Chili" from Bluey, and I went as an Enderman. There were a lot of very excited elementry boys at seeing a, relative to them at least, life size enderman.
After that played games with Ben. Explored the rest of the plains biome we were in and established that there were no guide stones to be found. We then set off for the mountains near the plains to get some silver. 
Lucy fell asleep while we were watching our show again at last. She still came to our bed 2-3 times last night and kicked me and such during the night. But it is progress to have her at lest start in her own bed. 
### October 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Games with coworkers for team bonding
2. Games with friends after work
3. A loving wife.

Thing I love about Megan: 
I can talk to her about my porn struggles and she genuinely wants to help me do better. 

Entry

Yesterday at work I puzzled for a little while on metrics and I think I might actaully be getting on the right track now. I have some hopes that this objective can be done!
We played star craft 2 for team bonding. It was quite an experience. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and say that it was the most fun they had for team bonding. I like that we've got a game that's alittle less dependant on luck and has a fair bit more depth. 
After work we had supper and then Megan and I had a conversation about how I had been struggling lust wise the last week or so. It was good to get out that I was struggling and for her to hear that I wanted sex in hopes of helping to contain these urges. I think in the future I'm going to at least try to clue her in to when I am struggling and thus might be in greater need of sex. 
We went to the armory to play hand ball but the goals they had were a bit on the small side and only 4 of us showed up. We just played around doing different ball games for an hour. We need to bring a pump to pump up all the balls since most of them were pretty flat. But it was still enjoyable.
After that it was video game night. We didn't make a lot of progress but we did get through one quest. Skyward sword is pretty fun.
### October 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A decent month
2. Hope in our doctor's visit today
3. A successful pumpkin shoot out

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very organized.

Entry

Friday was cycle review. All of Delta included Marmots in their review videos. It was glorious.
I tried doing some work on metrics but it was such a time sink, I tackled a couple other problems instead and got to a good position on some of them.
After work I lifted weights in the basement. It is a little annoying that the limiting factor for some of my exercises is my grip strength. Simply holding 35-45 pounds in my hands long enough to do the step ups or lunges can be a challenge.
After that I tried doing some reading and did eventually get through another section of the dragon book, but it was slow going. I then took a break and worked on the budget software for a little. I'm trying to get over a conceptual hurdle and get it so I can run the system on my server. No such luck yet. 
Saturday came. I made chocolate chip banana bread. I mopped the main floor, sweeping first most notably because Cordy is currently dead. (I later did some debugging and I'm convinced it's his battery. I have ordered a new one.) Did a little more with the budget and it was time for lunch, then I took a nap and we headed to the pumpkin shoot out.
The shoot out went great. I don't know why but I'm never quite wild about the shooting. I feel like I would like to do it more privately. I also don't want to hog the ammo since I'm a member of the missions team. I don't know if I am anywhere near that but I want to be certain. 
We were exhausted after the shoot out. Lucy slept the whole night in her bed. It was nice but I've gotten so used to her coming in that my subconscious is now semi awake waiting for the moment that she comes in meaning even though she never did I still didn't sleep great. So freaking annoying. That one is not her fault, my dumb subconscious won't just take a good thing at face value appearently.
Sunday was pretty good. I must have slept well enough because I didn't fall asleep in either of the services. After church we went to Pizza ranch and had a chance to chat with Mike Picananto for a little. I mentioned that I had some interest in serving but would really like to serve as a developer and mission organizations don't seem to be interested in hiring a developer. He gave me some ideas for apps that I might try out during this year's hackathon. It may be that in order to work as a missionary and a developer I'll need to carve my own niche in that world.
After lunch I worked a little more on the budget. I got scrapping to run headlessly and loaded it up on Alfheim. I am very happy about that. I now have it in a condition that I can share it with others. Made Ramen for supper and watched some MLP because I miss judged how much time it would take to make ramen. 
Lucy slept almost the whole night in her bed again. It was after 6 before she came to our room and I extracted her when I left and she slept in her bed until I woke her around 9. 
### November 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hope for future children
2. A short week
3. A day off to go to the doctor.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does want more children.

Entry

Yesterday was a day off work. I woke up, made breakfast, and then went up to wake up Megan and Lucy. I got Lucy ready for the day and sat down to journal. More or less just bided our time until 10 when it was time to depart. We drove off to OC and spent some time with my mom. It was nice. But the most important part of the day followed. 
We went to the hospital there in OC and met with Dr. Harrison Hanson who specializes in recurrant miscarriage. He detailed the probable problem but didn't end it with "So take this" rather we are now going to be attending some classes to learn how to do a new style of charting of Megan's cycles. This will help us get some indication of the progesterone levels in her body and we can then figure out if Megan needs supplements or if something else is the issue. In essence we are going to get more information and then figure out what to do. Megan and I both greatly appriciated this approach.
After we drove home I cut down some of the remaining plants, I still need to trim the cursed flower bed, and then we had supper. We went to the Arts and Culture presentation that Mike Picanato put on for us. It was good.
After we got back it was about time for bed. 
Megan commented about how nice the Orange city area is and I mused on the idea of moving back to that area now that we are not confined to Vermillion (cause Vermillion kinda sucks). I had always ruled it out as we really like SD, particularly the lack of income tax. But, maybe we should consider IA. It wouldn't be that bad. And if income tax is the biggest thing I've really got to wonder how much that truly matters. We should really consider if we really really want SD or if IA or NE would be fine.
### November 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D printer
2. Cubbies
3. One more warm day to take a nice walk bare foot in shorts.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans ahead

Entry

Appearently I forgot to write in my journal yesterday. So Tuesday I played catch up. Rewrote the autoconfig script to pull content from vault and the yaml config files in the project. After work I played some star craft with my co-workers for a bit then went and made supper. We were going to go to jolly's park(with the blue slides) with Tiahrts, but Arthie was naughty and had to stay home. So it was just Lucy and I.
After that I did my exercise and then ran through a HAM radio questions drill. Called it a night.
Wednesday. Justin critiqued my script and told me how to convert it to typescript. So I plugged away at that. Great progress and pushed a new version a little after lunch. Then I worked on validator issues and brought to the attention of the group validators that were dubious. After work I helped make supper and Megan took Lucy to Cubbies. Then I sorted our ripening tomatoes and we discussed plans for the weekend. I picked Lucy up and played games with Ben. Ben and I continue our inching towards victory. We got silver this last round and enouch thread to get me an armor upgrade. Next week we'll get Ben an armor upgrade and all go sailing I guess till we can find a guide stone to lead us to Yugloth. 
Lucy spent the whole night in her bed. I think I've lost count now, maybe 3 or 4 times she has? Huzzah!
### November 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Family get together
2. Rokenbok toys
3. Drugs to counter dog allergies.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is family minded.

Entry

Thursday worked on my autoconfig scripts. It was nice to stretch my legs with more coding again. After work was primarily just prepping for the weekend.
Friday morning, we wake up at my normal work time and pack up and head out. We stop in OC to pick up Gigi and drive off to worthington. We stop there for brunch and meet up with Brady, Julie, and Sam. I then rode with Brady to the lake house so we could have a guys and gals van just for giggles. I don't know if I'll do that again next year as it involves me sitting in a dog alergen riddled van for an hour, it was in pretty good condition by the time we got to the house though. 
It was a good weekend. The highlight was the rokenbok I'd say. We built 3 different quries, one each day basically. We also identified a number of things that will need to be repaired for next year. But over all it worked rather well. The whole weekend was very cordial and positive. I do think that things work out better when the weekend happens before election day rather than after. 
After we got home last night I mostly studied for my HAM radio test today. Huzzah! I will finally clear that hurdle. After I felt like I had studied enough I then went about trying to figure out why I couldn't connect to home assistant. It was the certificate issue again. This time I left sufficient notes to help me figure it out much faster should it happen again. 
### November 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Passing my HAM test
2. One more warm day
3. A free country

Thing I love about Megan: 
Sexy lady.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly caught up on things at work. I helped Drake and Emily try to resolve some issues in their environment that was causing problems for them. Worked for Drake, didn't work for Emily for some reason. 
Left work a little early to drive to Yankton to take a HAM radio test. Passed, not quite as high a margin as I had hoped, but I passed. The guys there asked if I wanted to join the club, and I might. But I hadn't eaten supper and I told Megan I'd be home so I had to skip for the evening. I expect my call sign next week.
Got home, had supper. Had some Lulu time, she wanted to play Mario Kart, and proceeded to fall asleep while we played. I got her ready for bed and that left Megan and I with some time to our selves, which was much appreciated. 
Lucy came to our bed several times during the night, it wasn't great. I'm tired.
### November 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. One last warm day.
2. A warm bed for the cold night.
3. Potential for more flowers.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks critically about things like our budget.

Entry

Yesterday I did some scaffolder updates to try to keep my metrics in the microservices I'm using for testing. I broke the build for billing and so spent a while fixing that. Fortunately the fixes I made to scaffolder came in super handy here and I just rebuilt billing with scaffolder. Worked like a charm.
After work I immediately went out to start transplanting the bleeding heart bush. I was hoping to find true bulbs like I did with the hosta, but it was more so just chunks of root it felt like. So I tried as best I could, I should have extracted it earlier in the year when it would have been easier, but alas, I failed. I then planted it and 4 bouques of tulips between the 3 parts of it I planted. Hopefully this will result in some lovely flowers in our front bulavard next spring, and not just a bunch of dead bleeding hearts.
After that we had supper and I started working on the budget. Megan has pointed out that maybe we don't need a budget. It it has become clear to me that primarily we use the budget for book keeping rather than budgeting. Megan has pointed out that maybe we don't need to be that careful any more. I think I get it but it feels crazy to not keep track of these things. I've proposed using another program perhaps to see what other people do and perhaps trim down on what we have to enter. We'll see. Alternatively, the main thing causing pain is the entry of receipts, and I am ever trying to make that simpler. But if we can get the bulk of it done by another program maybe it is moot. :shrug:
Played Valheim with Ben. We are now searching for a guide stone for Yugolath. Didn't have any luck last night.
Lucy started in our bed. at 3 she started coughing bad and Megan asked me to take her to her bed. Lucy said she wanted to be with mama once I got her there so I brought her back and proceeded to cough bad myself. It's rather annoying since I don't seem to be sick with anything, just a cough and runny nose. I suppose I should be grateful that I don't have anything else. Anyway, a while later, around 4, I took Lucy to her bed and bit the bullet and drank some cough syrup. It was aweful, but it allowed me to sleep. 
### November 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A warm house
2. A living breathing child
3. Games to play as a family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves Lucy

Entry

I tried getting metrics working from my local machine yesterday, no dice. So I went to fiddling with preview, no dice yet there, but there at least I'm just waiting for some fixes to come in. I changed my objective and focused in on sql metrics instead as a change of pace, had some luck there.
After work I ran, but only a short distance since I'm still recovering. It was 28 degrees out. The cold air kept my throat in check while I was running, but when I got in it swelled up and I coughed for a while. We had supper, I went to rehearsal, I came back and we played video games. It was a good evening.
### November 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice weekend
2. Nearing completion of Valheim for now
3. Healing

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is my wife.

Entry

Friday I didn't get as far as I would have liked, but I'm getting into the right mind set. I'm hitting a wall in this project and I'm realizing this is a make or break moment. I need to really dig in and figure out the problem and solve it and if I can then I will come out the other end a much more capable person.
After work I was feeling sick and so I just sat and read for most of the evening. Did a little work on the budget.
Lucy was coughing pretty bad thursday into friday so I was prepared this time to retreat to another room. I decided to go downstairs instead of to the guest room since the heat was on and it was only an hour and a half is till morning. Made breakfast, went to the Stewarts baby shower. Then we went to sioux falls to see if the dealship there could upgrade our infotaiment system to android auto, the receptionist seemed to think they could. But no dice. We are stuck with crap. After that we went to the dollar store just down the street from the dealership and Lucy proceeded to throw a fit. It was not a fun trip. Megan was not impressed with the selection so we stopped by the new dollar store in Vermillion on our way home. Picking out stuff for shoe boxes. Again, I mostly ran interception on Lucy and didn't help Megan very much. We really hoped Lucy would be interested but she was just so distracted by this and that so we never really got anywhere.
I decided against mowing the lawn as it was cold and I didn't feel well, next saturday is also cold so it didn't make much of a difference, just as long as I mulch the leaves. And maybe not even that, we'll see. Worked on the budget, got it finished and finished chapter three of the compilers book.
Sunday was fairly relaxing. I went to church early for rehearsal. It was "Inspire Action" Sunday. The reality of "oh, I'm also going to be given a sum of money to give to some one else" sunk in. It was a bit frightening and we haven't been out much to have the opportunity to give it. I don't know when we'll have the opportunity, or at least when I'll have the opportunity since I'm home basically all the time. 
I started fiddling with "You need a budget" and so far I'm not impressed. 
Played some Vlaheim by myself and then with Skylar for a little while. We got to and then decided to attack Yagluth. It didn't go great, but we have optomism for next week. 
Watched Ponyo for our Movie night. Such a great movie. Talked a fair bit about Shintoism and eastern religions afterwards.
### November 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The incredible bounty God has given us to take care of.
2. Our first dusting of snow
3. A warm house

Thing I love about Megan: 
She's beautiful

Entry

Yesterday was a slog. But a successful one. I have resolved the issue with my local machine not wanting to work with histograms. Hopefully this will allow me to debug further issues going forward.
After work I ran, just a short one yet as I am still recovering to my great dismay, freaking cold is lingering forever. We had supper and I worked on a few things around the house. Fixed the main floor bathroom ceiling with a fresh coat of duct tape. Put plastic over the upstairs bathroom window and Lucy's west window, should keep both those rooms warmer. Worked on the budget in the evening and scoped out a 1u server to use as a router. Asked the seller a question and hope to hear back soon. Managed to fiddle with 2 sensors before bed, both hall effect sensors. Doing sensors really doesn't take a lot of time, but I've got to sit down and do it, and yes, it is being very beneficial. It is eye opening seeing what they can and can't do.
Didn't sleep well last night. For some reason none of us could get to sleep for the longest time. 
### November 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. PTO
2. Snow!
3. Forgiveness

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a baby factory in her

Yesterday was a little slow. I got some aspects of graphing figured out but the afternoon was consumed by working with the DBAs to figure out what went wrong with staging victory feed. 
While I was chatting with them I worked a little bit on "You Need A Budget" and am starting to warm to it. It may be an acceptable to to get us up and running with an more reliable budget.
After work I lifted weights and we had supper and then I went to Tiahrts for Dads and Daughters (with Arthie). It was a fun evening for the 5 of us. Arthie is going to be doing wrestling on Tuesday nights soon so we'll probably do something else when that comes. Sabrina is very pregnant and due any day now. 
I tried doing things to clean up my habitica todo list yesterday after I got back. Got my missionaries moved over to my new email address for news letters. Then we cleaned for the robot, but we have no functioning robot. So I swept the floor manually. Props to the robot, it gets about the same level of dirt that I got, and then a bunch of cat hair and stuff out of the rug as well. 
### November 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Learning how to get more stats about Megan to hopefully prevent misscariages
2. Reliable cars
3. Game time with Megan

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys board games

Entry

Yesterday we went back to OC for an educational breifing. We learned how to do the more advanced mucus based charting. We really hope that this will provide us the insight necessary to be able to record Megan's hormone levels at different points in her cycle, which should allow us to get an idea of what might be causing the misscariages (and maybe the nausia as well). 
After the tutoring session we went to my Mom's for lunch and chilled there for a little while. Lucy had spent the morning there while we were at our session. Then we headed home. Lucy konked out on the way home and proceeded to sleep till we woke her at 5:15 so she could get to cubbies on time. I did the last of my winterizing chores. I wrapped the dining room window and dug two extra compost holes to get us through the winter. The one chore I would like to still do but looks rather ridiculous now is mow the lawn so I can mulch up all the leaves. I'm planning on it this saturday. It will look crazy since I'll be mowing the snow as well. and actually I don't even know if I'll be able to, the grass might be to wet. We'll see!
Megan and I played Agricola duel while Lucy was at cubbies. I picked Lucy up, and then played Valheim with Ben. I fortunately managed to find the alter for Yagluth so we are nearing the completion of our game so far. Hopefully Mistlands drops soon and we'll be able to have one more biome before we leave the game.
### November 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hope for future children
2. Exercise with friends
3. Skill

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is my wife

Entry

Yesterday I got side tracked by another pitch's needs. I made an update to Client API to get the switch user records coming in from clients. The PR is up but awaiting review. After that I dug into metrics and had zero luck figuring out the problem. Darn frustrating. 
After work I forget what I did between it and supper. I think I just messed around and chatted with Megan. After supper we went to the Armory and played hand ball. Megan, upon arrival, drove off to Tiahrts where Sabrina was resting. After hand ball Skylar took me there as well, and the 3 of us went home to play video games. Made it a little further in Skyward sword, we are just outside of the second temple now.
This is going to be a rough month. Megan and I are not allowed to engage in any intercourse while she gets calibrated on her cycle charting system. We can still be intimate but no genital contact. 
### November 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. New Garage doors!
2. Fixed tile floor coming together.
3. Winterizing complete.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a large family

Entry

Friday I worked on the Client API switch user event, rewrote my PR to make it simpler. Then I worked on debugging the missing metrics.
After work I did my leg exercises. We had supper, and I spent a while that evening working on sensors. Got 5 more under my belt, most of them a variation on tilt sensors. Then I played some video games and it was about time for bed.
Saturday I made us some health food muffins, they were pretty good. Trying to get more whole grains and nuts in my diet to bring down my LDL. After breakfast I decided that the first thing I need do was mow the lawn. Mostly to mow the leaves. It was a bit dusty but I got it done and now our lawn is ready to winter over. I also burned the brush that was waiting there.
Greg informed me that the doors were in and that we could expect him to install them early next week. Huzzah! New garage doors at long last! I've wanted them basically since we moved in. Our original doors are cracked and painted over and the weak spot in our garage's insulation. It will be nice to have foam core doors at last. 
After mowing I started working on the tile floor. The idea was to pull up the loose tiles, clean up the floor and tiles and then re-motar the tiles to the floor. We thought we might have spare tiles in the basement, but we didn't. So I thought maybe I would have to put the two (and then 3) shattered tiles down. But we thought maybe we could use different tiles as a kind of accent. And it looks like it will work. I made two trips to the hardware store to get everything, cleaned the mortar off the back of the old tiles I would still need, 4 in all, and then remortared the tiles down. It wasn't to exhausting, but friday was Leg day and so I was already a bit tired. I was fairly pleased with the result, the 5 replacement tiles make a "+" in the middle of our floor making it look intentinal. The mortaring is done, but I have to wait for it to dry some so I covered the floor with a plank so we wouldn't be stepping on it a bunch and called it a day. Did my other little chores, watering plants and changing batteries before I sat down to relax.
Earlier in the week I had a failure with pornography so my coins in habitica were really low. I tried to justify playing longer or something, but the point of me loosing those coins in habitica was to make me regret my poor decission to look at porn. I was not happy about it but this is hopefully how I can get some progress here. So after my game time ran out I sat down and read my will documents. Figured it was a good idea to read all the way through my will before I sign it. ^^;
Sunday was pretty relaxing. Went to church, I came home between services since I wasn't on sound. Played some spirit farer and tried to get started on a CE linux client. I wasn't met with much progress on the latter, I will need to ask for some guidance today. Picked Megan up, we had left overs for lunch, took a nap. Megan took Lucy to drop off shoe boxes, I played some valheim. Skylar didn't join and I was getting a little bored once Megan got back and we went for a walk.
After we got back I made some bread sticks and went about my normally weekly chores plus cleaning the garage up a bit so that Greg could do the garage doors the next day (Today! He's here now! woohoo!). We watched "Kiki's delivery service" for our family move night and had spinch artichoke dip. Then I played a little more spirit farer, finally finishing the first character so I felt like I was finally fully out of the tutorial phase of the game. Then it was time for bed.
### November 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lovely new garage door
2. Inching progress at work (slow, but it is progress)
3. My lovely wife

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cares about my health

Entry

Yesterday was a bit of a slog. I banged my head against walls until they started to give way a bit. I'm making progress, I at least now know what should give me the insight I need, binding a globalErrorHandler for OTEL, but I haven't figured out yet how to get such to happen.
By the time the work day was over Greg and Nick and finished our garage doors. They look NICE! I'm very pleased. The windows in the doors are going to take a bit to get used to. Several times in the evening I went out into the garage and thought that the doors were open, nope, just the windows. And Megan pointed out how different they make the garage feel because they are new and clean and flat. Again, it is glorious, I love the new doors. Now I need to fix up around the rest of the door frame to try and get it looking nice. I think I'd like to replace the rotten wood with PVC board and paint it to match. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to accomplish it though. I think I might turn to Brady for assistance. If I can get a 3D model of the door frame's contour brady should be able to CNC mill a slab of PVC to the right shape.
I ran for my exercise. Got home and added more ductape to the main floor bathroom's ceiling. Fiddled on my computer for a little trying to figure out if I could get TA:UberHack to work. I'll try again later on Megan's. We had supper. Then we hung up pictures in our stair case. One family picture for each year since we've been married. Unfortunately we've yet to find a 2018 picture. We may have failed entirely to take a picture that year. woops. Then I played with Lucy a little as we tried to clean the house up a bit. I read up on making AM radios since that is one of my objectives for this quarter. 
### November 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A fixed floor
2. A clean desk
3. An opportunity to get an ODROID GO

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans rigourously

Entry

Yesterday I made progress. I got the global error handler in place and wanted to see the results, but lo, the metric gaps disappeared! :shrug: frackin bugs. Now I'm trying to get the queries to spit out the right results.
After work I immediately started working on the floor. Gotta get the grot in before family gets here. As of this morning it is done enough so far as I care. There are some spots I wished I had taken a closer look at in the moment, but over all I'm pleased. It's taking my feet a little time to get used to. I feel like I should be gingerly walking over the floor but I don't need to do that anymore. No more grinding, no more crackling. It's so nice.
Tiahrts were up in Sioux Falls so no time with them last night. Instead Lucy and I played bears and hibernated in dens and gathered balls while Megan was off shopping. After she got back we did a couple things together and then I went about cleaning my desk. One part of the objectives for cleaning desk was stripping media. I pulled the second half of Bluey Season Two, but only as a monolithic file. I need try again this time pulling each chapter separately. 
We are at scramble time now. Particularly for Megan. Trying to get everything in place before family gets here tonight. They shouldn't be any earlier than 7 so it should be fine. 
### November 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My God
2. My family
3. My country

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a fun family
And tried iceskating!

Entry

Wednesday, banged my head on metrics. Made some small progress. Will continue work next week. Then in the evening did small things to get ready for the arrival of Megan's family.
Thanks giving weekend was enjoyable. My mom came for thanks giving dinner, she and Jeff chatted a bunch and at a different time with Cyndi. It was nice having her here. 
We played Agricola and Catan. I downloaded "Hidden in plain sight" for the switch and we had a couple good rounds of that, I'm glad I remembered it. We played just 2 levels of moving out, which amounted to 5 rounds. We played a couple rounds of stick fight. 
The two most notable events for me at least were when we went to the iceskating rink in Yankton to give Nathan a chance to practice before he takes Sam on a trip iceskating for their anniversery. But most notably I got Megan out on the ice too which was really fun. And then on Saturday evening Jeff, Nathan, Josh, Ben, and I went to the Brick House had a few drinks and chatted about Twitter and Musk and other random inconsequential things. And then we chatted a little about Nat and Josh's girl friends. Nat is still on the fence a little since her faith is not the strongest. He's waiting for after graduation to pursue things a little deeper. I hope it works out for him. Not just for him but of course I would be happy to see some anyone develop a deeper faith with God. Josh on the other hand when we asked him what are the odds he thinks she's the one he was like "yup." and that was about it. About what we expected to be honest. We always figured Josh would be pretty quick when he found some one he liked. 
All in all an enjoyable thanks giving. 
### November 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My ODroid Go that I finally acquired.
2. Snow!
3. Tasty nuts and seeds

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes such tasty food.

Entry

Yesterday I didn't get very far. It was mostly spent waiting on ansible scripts. I did also work with John and Mark to get the sql user change done in Client API. Huzzah!
After work I ran. Quite possibly the last run of the year. I only ran about 2.1 miles. I'm still feeling a little like I'm recovering. Having family with a dog and Lucy sick has made me a little under the weather. 
After that we made Corn Dogs for supper. After supper I started working on the new router. I finally got OPNsense setup on the machine! Turns out the big problem was that the sata ports were disabled. Enabled the one I needed and all was well. It also took FOREVER to do the installation and so I eventually stopped waiting for it and went about doing other things. Most notably watering the plants that didn't get watered over the weekend. I also did two more sensors, most interesting of which was the thermistor. Then it was time for bed. 
### November 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Snow
2. People to help me at work
3. Sleep. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Lets me do some crazy things some times. (like build a server rack under our basement steps)

Entry

Yesterday I got some progress on the metrics. By the end of the day production otel collectors had been updated and metric logging was back on in staging and production. Also did some client API stuff with Mark.
After work I shovelled snow and considered that my exercise for the evening. I went with just the shovel to encourage more exercise. After that I came in and looked into trying to make an AM radio. I'm not so sure about this objective. I may put it off in favor of other more important tasks. I took a nap with Lucy and then we had supper. Then I spent the rest of the night working on the server rack. This has been an objective of mine for a long time so I'm glad I'm finally getting to it. I think I will focus on that task for a while. Both the construction of the rack and the configuring of the machines that are going into it. One of the most important things I need to work on for it right now though is getting an outlet over there to provide power to that area. I'll try to solve that this weekend. 
### December 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. My wife
2. My home
3. My servers :D

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very smart.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. I got stimied a bit but ended the day feeling like i can move forward on recreating the dashboards for metrics. Huzzah!
After work I went down to the basement to work on my server rack. I dismounted it and created a little platform for a piece of sheetrock to sit on. This closes up the gap between the walls and makes things over all look nicer. I hope to clean it up and paint it yet so it will look very nice when I am done. I had to run to the hardware store after supper to get some more spackle to finish the job. I also grabbed a few things for the outlet I'll need to put in, and while I was at it got stuff for the sump pump outlet.
After that we worked on cleaning up the house for dreamy's (or maybe dreme?) first run. Our new vacumm robot. It talks. We aren't fond of that feature. I liked simple beeps. But the robot does seem a fair bit more capable. It ran with only 2 incidence: a shoe lace we missed, and a string on our front door mat that was starting to run. Niether of those were it's fault. 
This got me to playing with Ben a little late as I got distracted by the robot. But to games we got. And to Yagluth we got. Ben and I beat the game, so far as it exists so far, last night. I think we'll play star craft 2 for a while. Which gives me a chance to practice that for playing with Co-workers. Excellent. Oh but it looks like mistlands is coming out very soon.
### December 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A month off from Gamelan
2. An end insight for metrics
3. Memes

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is gracious.

Entry

Yesterday went pretty well. I go the scaffolder update for metrics done and I hope to get it merged before next tuesday. Then I started working on converting more graphs. It's moving along nicely.
After work my mom was still here because she was having troubles getting her new phone setup. I was helping her and night set and so she stayed the night. We had supper, I went to rehearsal, Megan, Lucy, and my mom joined Amanda and went to the parade of lights which appearently was mostly done by the time they got there. Lucy having not helped any in this process.
I got home before they did and I fiddled with my lighting controller which is having mysterious issues with the front porch light. I still don't know what is wrong. 
After they got back we played some Skyward sword. I even gave my mom the controllers for a little to try the motion controls. Since Sam's love language is appearently games, not un like me at his age, mom is a little interested in developing basic competency in games these days. That's fun.
### December 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lovely christmas tree
2. Simple decor
3. A server rack coming together. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks deeply out faith

Entry

Friday had the CE Christmas party. Then got back to work on Grafana queries. Finished 2 more. I needed to figure out some configuration issues that I though I might need to throw out in a question to the OTEL community but so far I seem to have figured it out on my on. We shall see. That will be today's work.
After work we had a Christmas party for the sunday school teachers. It was fairly enjoyable. I chatted with a fellow, Jason (can't remember last name, shutzmen or someting). He had done IT work at Citi Bank so was not only tracking with me when I talked about what we do at CE but was asking questions. He was trying it would seem to get my perspective on containerization and Kubernetes. I am very pro container. It was a fun conversation.
Worked a little more on the cleaning up the server rack after we got home. Things are coming together quite nicely.
Saturday morning arrives I make orange cranberry scones. We watch the first part of a lecture series by Jordan Peterson on the book of Genesis. I reorganize our media center/cabinet and get the new soundbar working correctly. That cabinet was in desperate need of a dusting. We have lunch. Then we head out to Yankton. We stop by menards to pickup some shelving and then go to the nursery and pick our christmas tree. We got home, set it up. I clean the kitchen and cook supper while Megan and Lucy decorate. It was a nice evening.
Sunday comes, I head off to church and was very surprised to see Noah wanting to run soundboard for rehearsal and first service. This threw me off balance most of the morning. After church we came home, had lunch, and prompty returned to church for a cookie decorating event. It was enjoyable. We came back, I took a nap, and then started playing Valheim. Yagluth killed me and broke my portal. All motivation gone. Having beaten Yagluth in my world with Ben I called it good and have officially put Valheim down. I tried playing spirit farer but was getting board with it as well. I tried to switch to classic smash but the N64 was once again not outputting to the TV. I wish I knew what caused this. So I fiddled with server rack stuff. Unfortunately the edge of the stairs is going to prove to be an annoyance for server equipment. I'm going to have to be more strategic than I hoped as to where I place server equipment, and even what equipment can go in. Also, the rack brackets that they sent with the cisco switch came with the wrong screws. So I can't currently mount the switch. That's annoying. 
We watched "The Red Baloon" last night since we couldn't think of what movie we wanted to watch, and so we watched an old short movie. It's hard to find one that isn't scary to Lucy. And if we pick one that just goes over her head entirely she will loose interest and annoy the living daylights out of us. We ended up playing some Zelda last night, that was enjoyable. 
### December 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A sharp mind
2. Screws that fit
3. A cozy bed

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is nice to hug.

Entry

Yesterday was a good day. I could tell because my brain felt very tired by the end of it. Lots of thinking. I like it. A day I feel like I truly did good work.
After work I took stuff out to the compost hole. Then we sat down for supper. We had chicken soup since Megan made some for the Tiahrts who are currently fighting a cold. After that I made a quick run to the hardware store to see if they had screws that fit my cisco switch. And they did. They weren't quite the same as they had tips instead of flat heads, but they worked, and I got my switch mounted. Then Megan cut my hair and I took a shower. After that I started fiddling with the servos I bought to teach myself a thing or two about servos. Man, the thermometer would have been dramatically easier from the get go if I had used servos instead. I've got a fair bit left to figure out, and my "servo project" for this month is going to be creating a servo module that will work with these servos, but it is definite progress. I'm excited. Which hasn't been true of this project in a long time. I tried to do some of the sensors for my sensor project this week and they were mustly bust. Never buying a sensor pack again.
### December 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Budgeting software
2. Time with Lucy
3. I job working from home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants to raise Lucy right

Entry

Yesterday was not quite as productive as monday, but that's a hard act to follow. I tried to do a work around current OTEL limits, no dice. Then I did scaffolder updates after the all employee meeting.
After work I greased the garage doors and did my exercise. It was Papa night and before it was to start Lucy had to put her dishes away. This caused a puddling. A harbinger of the rest of the evening. I worked on the budget some while she calmed down and eventually we got to papa time. We played with boxes and balls and all sorts of good stuff. When the time was done we set her down to watch some shows to calm down and she started jumping on the sofa. This lead to some disciplinary actions. She watched another show and then we told her we had to clean for the robot. She of course needed to go to the bathroom then. Bit by bit she faught us on everything. It turned into a huge deal as we progressed to getting ready for bed. Megan was angry, I was angry, Lucy was upset and grumpy. It was not pretty. Megan and I had a long conversation after we finally got Lucy ready for bed. We don't know what to do. Lucy is not listening to us. She falls to the floor and claims she can't get up when we ask her to do things. Whether she believes she can't get up, because she is over whelmed, or not is up for debate. Eitherway it is infurating. I'm ok with my child not listening to me on occation or even taking a little bit to follow through, wiggle in the joints is fine. But throwing a fit and not listening at all is another thing. I am getting very tired of her attitude.
### December 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chance for intamacy with Megan
2. Heat
3. Delightfully chilly weather. Huzzah winter!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes playing games.

Entry

Yesterday was pretty good. I wrote a PR for removing the need for the Movers and mostly just researched Kuberenetes and Harness. 
After work I did some coding on the budget. I got the export page to remember what cost center you set for each order. Woke up Lucy, had supper, she went to cubbies and Megan and I played "Kayakchoas" to try to asertain if it would be an enjoyable game. We'll play it again at her folks place with 4 people and see if it's worth hanging on to. Had some time to ourselves before picking up Lucy.
Ben and I had been planning on playing Starcraft 2, but the new patch for Valheim just came out. SOOOOOO, back to Valheim. I spent the evening building a staircase to the upper portion of our base and then I built a long house for more portals. We ran out of space in our portal silo. Next week we hope to be both out on the hunt for mistlands.
### December 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Interesting things to research
2. A loving God
3. Hope for a future

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants more children.

Entry

Research on harness was most of my day yesterday. Nothing much to chat about. After work I did some work on the budget, trying to get that finished shortly. It's almost done. We had supper, then we headed off to the Armory. I played hand ball, ran myself ragged, Devon and I did very well in a 2v3 and actually won. My stature certainly aided in that. After the game Skylar took me to their place where Megan and Lucy had been spending the evening. Picked up my family and we headed home. Played Skyward sword till bed time.
The snow we were promised didn't really come down, we were quite disappointed. But this morning it had! And, it even came down soft and gentle so the trees are all covered with gorgeous layers of snow. It is very picturesque. 
### December 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Snow!
2. Anime
3. Progress on my server rack

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves traditions

Entry

Friday wasn't quite as productive as I would have hoped, but there were meetings so it happens.
After work, golly, I've forgotten what I did. The most important thing was preparing cinnamon rolls for the next day. They didn't rise much, the yeast was probably dead. 
Saturday morning I get up and throw the cinnamon rolls in the oven to proof and then to cook. while that's happening I am working on the server rack, doing the noisy parts of the project and hopefully finishing them. I took some of the steps off the landing and put the gang box for the sump pump outlet in place. Huzzah! Finally got the hard part done there. I've got to get a GFCI outlet yet to finish the project, but that is trivial. After breakfast I worked on cleaning up my work space a bit while chatting with Brady. I labeled that conversation as "paranoia" in my bullet journal since that was kind of the topic of the conversation. First paranoia about government, then about business, etc. It was an enjoyable chat. By the end of the day I had made great progress on the server rack, but I had run into a problem where I needed DHCP to setup the proxmox server that was going to be the base of the machine, but I needed the proxmox server setup to setup the OPNsense server that would run DHCP. I ended up using an old router to act as the DHCP server temporarily while I setup the proxmox server. That got me off the ground and by bed time I had a proxmox server up and accessible.
Sunday morning, went to church. Came home and I was thinking I should relax instead of work, but I was so enthralled with the server project that I wanted to do it instead of relaxing. So I got OPNsense up and running. I was nearly working but ran aground on some DNS issues. I posted a question on Reddit and then worked on "Advent of Code" problems. Gotta catch up on those. Before the end of the day though I got an answer and was able to get my network connection working. Huzzah! My new router works!
Between all that we went to a Santa Lucia celebration in the Dalesburg Lutheran Church. Unfortunately we sat at a table with other guests so it wasn't a terribly social experience for us. It was kinda fun though. And they sang the Santa Lucia song so I was happy.
### December 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Eggnog
2. Code challenges
3. Hackathons

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is cozy in bed.

Entry

Yesterday I made my review video, did some experimenting with Harness, and then started fiddling with hackathon. I'm going to try to make a Linux client. I've made a promise to myself that if I can't create a linux client I'm going to install windows on my personal desktop. It is the metaphorical gouging out of my eyes. In this case better run a windows machine than burn for eternity. 
After work I started fiddling with freecad but then switched gears and decided to do AdventOfCode puzzles. I got through several before I fried out on one dealing with file trees. After that I worked on freecad, coming up with a design to redo the thermometer. To be fair I should really figure out how to the coding and prove out the mechanics of it before I invest to much time in the whole project. But yesterday was mostly measuring and tearing down the existing thermometer. At this point I'm looking at replacing the body of the clock as well, the only component that will remain is the curved glass cover. I should put that some where safe so it doesn't get damaged.
### December 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Time with Lucy
2. Silly little games
3. Hope for a linux client

Thing I love about Megan: 
That we have a wonderful relationship already going into the Crighton Fertility method. 

Entry

Not much to talk about yesterday. Read some code and some docs.
I got access to ChatGPT yesterday and asked it some interesting questions. I enjoy it. But most interestingly I look forward to using it as a coding accelerator. I used it to write the sql queries for the database I want to use for our budget/finance software. It did a great job and taking the hodgepodge of thoughts and turning them into correct tables. I approve.
We went to Walmart for Lucy time last night. Lucy and I played in the little arcade, which was really not that exciting but Lucy liked it. She rode the car twice and did the claw machines a few times. We did some gacha games and got some sticks and stuff. Most amusing was she got a little baggie of lego guns. xD After we ran out of quarters we went and picked out fabric for Megan's Christmas present, and some stocking stuffers. 
We went home and I finally got Plex to understand our Phineas and Ferb collections. Huzzah! At last! We went upstairs and discussed our "SPICE" assessment and how we should be intimate outside of sex. Watched the first epside of season 2 of TOS.
### December 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My wife
2. A chance to make a linux CE client
3. Games for good exercise

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is precise

Entry

I appearently missed yesterday. So on the 14th I didn't accomplish much, just kinda waiting for Andrew to be free. We had the cycle review.
After work on the 14th I played with Lucy for a while and then tried to do some more advent of code and didn't get very far. I think at this point I'm going to abandon it as I just don't have the time with everything else I want to do between now and next saturday. Then I played some Valheim with Ben. We both set sail in search of the mistlands, Ben found some several times but never a big enough biome to mean anything. Late in the evening I managed to sail into some real mistlands and get murdered. But I had a portal so it was all good. Ben came along to help me retrieve my armor and he said my mistlands looked far more likely to be useful than his. So next week we shall delve deeper into the mist. 
Yesterday my day started off with an outage, which plauged me basically all day. But in the late afternoon I met with Andrew Keller and he helped me get off the ground and start making progress towards an actual linux client. Right now I'm in the phase of attempting to just get things to compile. Andrew expects that will be most of the effort. Nice. After that I probably can just make a few scripts to patch things together.
After work I forget what I did, I think it was just cuddling with Lucy for a little before it was supper time. After supper it was Handball time. The evening started off as a struggle in a 3v3, but I think Issac wore out and my team scored a victory. Though I also rolled my ankle which was less great. 
After that we came home and played some LoZ:Skyward Sword. There are all these targets everywhere that we are at this point are convinced are for the hook shot in our current area. So I'm looking forward to having the hook shot soon.
### December 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. New lights in the basement
2. Stardew valley
3. Further progress on the linux client

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does try to help me control my sexual urges when we are in a time of abstinance. 

Entry

Friday I worked on the linux client in the morning, harness in the afternoon. Made some good progress on the linux client.
After work on friday I shovelled some snow and then worked on free cad. Trying to complete the "servo project" objective. I learned to make gears.
Saturday morning I did more of the same and got an initial bracket made for the servo. Progress. Learning to think in the freecad way. I like it. After lunch I went down to the basement to work on the drone room. I was hoping to redo the lighting and reorganize the place and paint the side table that's been sitting down there waiting for paint. I accomplished the lighting. It was a little more annoying than I had hoped it would be. It took a bit of effort to tear down the existing half functional lighting, replace the junction boxes that were built into the fixtures with new gang boxes, wire them all up and then attach the new tube lights and make their cables neat. But the end result is quite nice. The drone room for once is fully and evenly lightup. That's nice. Hopefully I'll be able to do a little more clean up soon. I would like to get the painting done espectially so I can remove the dresser and the remaining extra kitchen cabinet.
Sunday was pretty nice. Went to church. Came home after the first service and I worked on the servo bracket and gears. Went back and picked up Megan and Lucy. Came back home and I put the finishing touches on another bracket and printed it. After lunch when the print was done I assembled the result and I had succeeded in my servo project, and also failed. I did the gear reduction backwards so instead of increasing the servo's sweep from 180 degrees to 360, i decreased it to 90. But I'm still calling it a success as I learned to use freecad and made a nice object, even if it didn't fulfill my hoped objective. 
I tried to take a break and play some games after I finished that, but nothing was interesting me. I tried playing evil genius but it failed to hopen on wine and I couldn't be bothered to figure it out. I ended up playing Stardew valley. I'm a little saddened by my current state of "nothing is interesting" right now. It's a bit of a boring life not finding excitement in any video game.
We watched "Beauty and the Beast" last night. It was fun watching it as an adult and a parent. The golden era of Dysney just had so much interest and detail shoved into it. Never really realized it before.

Is a solid christian

Yesterday I didn't get as far as I had hoped. But it did pave the way for today I hope. I banged my head on building boost slowly stripping away things I assumed we needed. This morning I got a successful build by just build generic boost and it seems to have worked fine, more on that tomorrow. But the point being I spent the whole day trying to get boost to compile with no luck.
After work I did my exercise, we had supper, after supper I finished installing an outlet for the sump pump so that project is officially and completely done. Huzzah! I removed some extra wire left over from saturday's lighting excapades as well. After that I worked on my servo project again a bit. After several steps in my train of thought I realized that instead of a pair of bevel gears, I could use a crown gear and a involute spur gear instead and so far it looks very promising. I took a break when i realized it was 8 in the evening and switched to sensors to try and finish out that project before the end of the quarter. Got through 4 more sensors. I think I have 5 left. 
### December 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun games.
2. My precious little one.
3. Hackathon

Thing I love about Megan: 
Helps keep me healthy.

Entry

Yesterday was interesting. Kevin needed my assistance at one ponit so I started helping him and then ran aground and actually needed Andrew to get him unstuck. So most of the morning was Kevin, Andrew, and myself all chatting away at Kevin's problems and then my problems. It was enjoyable, gave a good hackathon sort of feel. Over all good progress was made by the end of the day. 
After work I was going to take Lucy out to play, but she was still napping. (she had fallen asleep on my lap while I was still at work. it was pretty cute). So I held her while Megan made supper. And just as Lucy woke from her nap I was ready to nap. Go figure. I tried to rest a little while she poked my face and eventually I pushed her off. We had supper. And then we bundled up as warm as we could. It was -0.4f degrees when we went outside. We stayed out 27 minutes as far as I could estimate an had a good time on the snow mauntains. After that we came in and wrapped Megan's christmas presents. That made my back ache so I decided to just play games that evening, I have the coin in habitica after all. I got "Evil Genius" to work and started playing that. 
### December 22nd 

Things I'm thankful for


1. Inching progress, hopefully I can finish the linux client in some capacity.
2. Once again, our new furnace. negative 17 right now.
3. Progress in my and Ben's Valheim game. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
She has a massive rack.

Entry

Yesterday I was depressed by the end of the day. I feel so close yet at the same time like this is an impossible task. I'm psycologically preparing myself to install windows on my desktop. But I've got a built OpenCV-PDL as of this morning which means I just need snowball to compile and we should be good. Here's hoping Andrew can help me.
After work Lucy was upset so I tried to calm her down, this resulted in me playing stardew valley with her on my lap. I wanted to play "evil genius" but I figured she would enjoy stardew valley more. It mostly worked. We had supper. After supper I joined Megan's game of stardew valley for kicks and gigles for a little bit. I also completed one more sensor. Which means I have experimented with all the sensors proper in my sensor kit now. The only two I haven't done yet that I would still like to do are the joystick and the rotary encoder. But those are kind of different sensors since they are input devices.
After that played Valheim with Ben. It was enjoyable, but also very tough the mistlands are no joke. I died a bunch and now my armor is stuck in a cave. Le sigh.
### December 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. My loving wife
2. My sweet little girl
3. Things beyond this world

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me despite my failings.

Entry

Yesterday Andrew and I made pretty good strides towards finishing the Linux Client POC. In doing this work I even uncovered a bug for Andrew in Zarf. Hopefully we can finish it and get a basic proof of concept going by the end of the day! Cause if I don't, the windows cometh. I also worked a little on harness yesterday and I think I'm making good strides towards accomplishing our objectives there.
After work I did two more sensors, the rotary encoder and the joystick. They are fun little human interface devices. Then we had supper and played Skyward Sword for the rest of the evening. Megan played for the first half then I the second. We beat the temple of time. Onward to new things next time we play.
### January 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A long Christmas holiday
2. A mysterious future
3. Meds to keep the dog alergens in check

Thing I love about Megan: 
Sees our future up in the air as much as I do. 

Entry

The end of the year has come. We spent the last week of it at Megan's folks and grand folks places. We spent most of the days at her folks but slept at her grand folks. This is primarily for my sake. Sleeping at the grandfolks gives me time away from the dog alergens so I can recover and not be miserable. It was an enjoyable vacation for the most part. I feel like I didn't accomplish much but I did get some good relaxation in so that's a positive. I did a fair bit of research on personal finance software and have come pretty solidly to the conclusion that I want to make my own. 
On the way home Megan and I chatted about various things and she pointed out how it seemed like our importance to Hillside has diminished. There are more sunday school teachers, there are more tech people. Some of our other ties to Vermillion seem tenous. Perhaps God is preparing us to be called to a mission field. I threw out the idea of working with the orphanage Smart every day mentions in his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRESqj6onwA). It came up in my mind after we had a miscarriage where since we were having trouble with our own children, why not raise a bunch in an orphanage? It's crazy, but not the craziest thing ever. It is in the easter time zone so if I could have an internet connection it would be theoretically possible to continue to work for CE while working down there. 
### January 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Being boxed in by accountability software.
2. Snow! `\^_^/`
3. Interesting problems to solve

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of the house and household

Entry

Yesterday I caught up on things at work. It didn't take long since there wasn't a lot happening over christmas break. I made good progress on harness and I helped Emily with some things.
After work I had a copy of windows ready to install on my jump drive and reformatted my personal computer to windows and installed Covenant Eyes on it. With that every device of note is now covered by CE. My kindle isn't, but that's not a big deal since it's an e-reader. My old phone isn't but that to should be a big deal since everything on our local network should be pretty well blocked and reddit now requires a login to view it's mature content, AWESOME! And I can already feel the hemming in. It will be interesting to see how this effects me. Am I going to boil over like a pot? Or will these next 3 months go by relatively without issue and I'll be out from under the influence of porn at last? Who knows.
Alfheim's hard drive hit pre-failure yesterday. It's lasted us now 3 years. I've disconnected it to attempt to prolong it's life as I get the new server equipment ordered. Between the 7th and the 11th the hardware should come. So next week I should be able to get Alfheim back up and keeping things rolling as we transition to Udgard. 
### January 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Snow! and lots of it
2. Progress on harness
3. A good nights sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very thoughtful. 

Entry

I struggled to get things working in harness yesterday but did in the end succeed. It was glorious. I am pleased.
After work I blew the snow away from our drive. It is delightfull panked full and there is a chance it will stay such till spring at this point. Huzzah! Winter is back at last.
It was supposed to be Papa time last night but Lucy was busy throwing fits and falling asleep so we didn't end up doing such last night. Instead I mostly worked on my bullet journal. I did a bit of research into various things to try and narrow down what I'm going to be working on this coming quarter and i think I've got that mostly sorted. I need to sort out what I'm doing for leg exercises yet but beyond that I'm all set to start making pages.
Started playing Homeworld Mobile yesterday. It seems kinda fun. I like the attention to fleet arrangements and such that make it feel different from Eve, but it feels a lot like Eve. 
### January 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. ChatGPT
2. More snow!
3. Fun with Harness

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes our kitty

Entry

Appearently I forgot yesterday. Gotta get used to this new approach using my git journal instead of sshing into the server.
Wednesday I dealt with some metrics meltdowns and other tid bits while making slow progress on harness. After work I had Lulu time straight away. We played with Magos, then with foam swords, then we went outside and played in the snow till Lucy had to go potty. We had supper and I worked on my bullet journal till it was time to play games with Ben. Ben helped me recover my armor in Valheim and we proceeded to clear out the infested mine. I then sailed the whole way around the island so I could find if there were any other biomes attached to these mistlands, there are in fact. I will make a portal to the plains I found next week. That will be nice. We are also going to need more black metal for some of the things we are going to be doing there so it's nice having a source near by.
Thursday I did spent the morning working on entering services into harness. 20 of them. It was all grunt work so I watched youtube videos about Homeworld Lore while I did. It was fun hearing about all the HW lore that's out there. After that I tried to work on the secrets but was seriously foobarred when I tried to get the API to work.
After work I shoveled some snow since there was enough on the side walk to warrant it. After that I worked on my bullet journal for a while. I was using ChatGPT to help me recreate some of my templates, or update them to new flexibility. It was great! I really dig using ChatGPT to deal with some of those fiddly bits.
Then we played Skyward sword and made it a fair ways in that before we had to call it a night.
### January 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A new bullet journal
2. A week without porn incident
3. Lots of snow

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is adventurous

Entry

Friday I finished creating all the services and then I turned my attention to secrets. Got a little bit of work to do on such but I'm glad to see I can use an api and won't have to move all 400 by hand.
After work I think I mostly worked on my bullet journal. Gotta get that done! I got it printed before the end of the day to my delight.
Saturday I made donuts and we watched more Jordan Peterson on Genesis. Then I sweeped the upstairs and polished the floor. While I was doing that Megan and Lucy were taking down our scant Christmass decor. We got the tree down and took it to the drop spot then went to clay county park to see the frozen Missouri. If I had snow shoes I'd be interested in going out there. But since it is a river it is a bit terrifying. If you break through you could be swept down stream and drown because the ice blocks you in. Scary.
After we got back I stiched up my bullet journal thus completing the index for this year, unless I go to the effort of including all of these journal entries as well. We'll see how many pages it adds up to. 
Then I worked on the budget for a while until it was time for me to make fish and chips for supper. After that I sat down and started a new game of Evil Genius. An enjoyable little sim game. Went to bed.
Sunday. Went to church. I came home after the first service and prepared for the missions team meeting and played more evil genius. Returned with Rhubarb cobler and herbed rice. I watched some videos on the "Not Forgotten" orphanage that Smarter Every Day supports. I think I'm going to talk to Megan about getting on their patreon. It seems like a reputable place to send our offering money. 
Missions team meeting went fairly well and we decided to skip march. Came home, took a nap, unfortunately Lucy did not. Then I played more evil genius. Lucy was a bit annoying crawling all over the place and then as she was complaining fell asleep at about 4:30. She slept till about 6:30 when we got her up. She had managed to wet herself without waking up. I made supper and we watched "Airplane" which was fantastic. A great satire. And everything we ever dreaded about the flying I think. It was very funny. Then played some more evil genius and went to bed.
I forgot to mentioin. Saturday night trying to go to bed was rough. My mind got stuck thinking about the great beyond. What if I am wrong? What if I'm decieving myself and I actually am worshiping something other than God? I spun on it till I felt sick to my stomach. We go on through life as if death is the thing at the end of the journey, but it's more accurate to say we are walking on a thin sheet of ice and any moment it could break beneath us and we'd be gone. I felt the weight of my sin pressing down on me. And believe it or not I attribute some of this to my act of obedience when I installed windows on my desktop so I could install covenant eyes on my personal machine. My one act of obedience has made it possible for me to hear where I am next failing. I don't know where God will take me on this and I feel like I've just peeked the edge of the cliff and am not ready for this. It's only been a week that I've had windows on Tellurium, I'm expecting recovery from porn to take at least the entire quarter. 
### January 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Time to do lots of interesting things
2. New server hardware coming in the mail
3. Progress at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Puts up with me

Entry

Yesterday I made a bit of progress. I spent longer than I probably needed on the script that transfers all the passwords for the harness update but I made a nice script which is always a satisfying experience. After lunch I started working down the list of micro services and doing test deployments of them into staging to ensure the pipeline works for every MS. 
After work I setup my new exercise bike. The axel is a little long and my seat hurts so I'm going to go to the bike shop on saturday and see if I can fix both of these issues. 
After that and supper I worked on the budget some more, attempting to get everything up and running again on my new install. I sorted out walmart and got it all uploaded. Since budget isn't really a time sensitive issue I'm also attempting to knock out one of my bullet journal items: Automate Hyvee. I didn't end up getting to it as by the time I got to it there was not much time left in the evening and Lucy was being very distracting.
### January 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A time to try making a CE Linux Client.
2. A huge pile of snow
3. Cool new server stuff!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has faith that challenges my own.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on harness and got all 20 micro services to deploy in staging and HQE to deploy in production. I'm fairly confident in it at this point so I'm looking to smooth the transition from old to new now. 
After work Lucy and I played foam swords and then went out and played on the snow. I dug a sled slope into the giant, like 12 foot, pile of snow sanford dropped across the road. 
After that I worked on the hyvee budget automation. I had been a little intimidated by this task looking at what I had done for walmart. But I've realized now that I could greatly simplify the walmart logic and so I'll probably do that after I'm done with Hyvee. Which I'm pretty close to achieving, at least for the purchases in store. I'll have to make scrapper in addition to the uploader to gather the info from the purchases made with aisle online.
Inbetween my efforts to automate we had supper. After supper I went down to the basement to unbox my new r410 server. I was very concerned about it fitting, but it just does. Whew! I also tried to do my exercise after supper but that turned out to be a bad idea. The food in my belly made it hard to do the exercise.
We finished MASH last night. The show has also been part of my musings of the great beyond as it necessarily brought with it death and the question of why does anything matter. It was a good show but I am glad to have it done. 
### January 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Amazon
2. Cost effective ways to get server hardware
3. Lucy's excitement for cubbies. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Most of my morning yesterday was spent preparing for the hackathon. After that I banged my head for a while on harness.
After work things came fast and furious. Arthie showed up as he was dropped off by Tiahrts on the way to mass. I helped Megan a little getting ready for supper and mean while I went down and looked at my new server and figured out how to extract the drive caddies. Alas I lack the requisite screws to put the drives into the cadies. About that time it was time for supper. We eat and Megan took the kiddos to cubbies. I picked out "Prime Climb" as our board game for the evening. It had a fair bit more strategy that it appeared to at first blush. Which was nice. Then Megan dropped me off at the hardware store while I searched for screw for the hard drive caddies. I found some that had promis but ended up being to big and would not let the caddies slide in. So I ended up ordering some screws off of amazon. Then played Valheim with Ben. Got a little more acustomed to the mist lands and cleared another infested mine. Went to bed.
### January 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Video Games
2. Hope for more children
3. Lovely winter weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes snow.

Yesterday I didn't make anywhere near the progress I wanted to. I struck out entirely trying to get grafana to bend to my will. I'm quite annoyed by that. In the afternoon I tried to work on the preview pipeline to no avail and so I went to try some work on the Deploy pipeline and managed to get colo selection to work. woohoo!
After work I tried to get my new server, Udgard, up and running with Proxmox so I could start configuring it and transfer the media from our media drive over to the pair of NAS drives. It got to the "Configuring Memory" stage and hung. Not sure what is going on there. Didn't have time to diagnose it further. Will try tonight.
Then we had supper. I dropped Lucy and Megan off at Tiahrts for Penelope's birthday and went on to praise band rehearsal. Came back and we played Skyward Sword till bed time. Put new nice cozy sheets on our bed. Lucy fell asleep in her bed and spent most of the night there. By about 6:20 in the morning she woke up and walked into our room. I beconned her to me instead of to Megan since I realized I would be waking up shortly anyway. Lucy came over and cuddled with me for half an hour till I got up. It was nice.
### January 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A repairable garage door
2. A productive weekend
3. People to help me debug my new server

Thing I love about Megan: 
Desires physical intimacy

Entry

Friday got preview environments to deploy through harness, now I need to figure out how to do it automatically. Spent some time reading the Git hub actions to attempt to understand such. I also looked into some graylog errors.
After work I went down stairs and did my exercise biking and then attempted to figure out what was wrong with my server. Using some tips from my co-workers I tried many things, but none of them worked. So I still have no functioning server. I sent the seller a message but haven't heard back from them. I've got two more options to explore: Resetting the BIOS and updating the BIOS. We'll see if I can get them to work.
I finished the budget automation for injesting hyvee receipts that are emailed to us, just in time for hyvee to seemingly not send us emails with our receipts anymore. I'm very confused. I need to send them a help desk ticket. But we also don't get emailed a receipt for orders got through aisles online so I have started working on injesting from that source too.
Saturday came and I made Lemon muffins and prepared for a busy morning. Megan and "Women Renewed" that morning and I needed to run to the bike store. So she dropped me off on the way there. I picked up a new axel for my bike, it was still to long darn, and a new light bulb for our microwave from Murphs. 
Got home and I started chipping away at my chores. I mopped the floor and then the big one, I re-roped the cat's climbing/scratching tree. A lot of hot glue and an aching back later I was done. I also vigourously brushed it all over to make it feel like new. It was good work. 
I did some other little tasks and worked on the budget till supper. Showered (with Lucy which wasn't a great experience), and then I tried to work on the budget more but Megan put on "How it's Made" for Lucy, I couldn't focus during that so I started playing Evil Genius and a few minutes later Lucy switched to Ada Twist anyway. 
Sunday came and I ran sound, played some homeworld mobile. After church, lucnh, and nap time, I decided it was time to tackle the damaged garage door. Megan had previously just bearly ran into the door while it was still moving and knocked the trim off the bottom. I pulled the rubber seal out and bent and hammered things till to try to get it back into shape. Some of the damage is irrevicable, but the door works and the trim is back on. Life goes on. Though I did also ram the drill into the pad of my left thumb while trying to drive a screw at one point. That hurt. Had to put a bandaid on it. Played more Evil Genius until prep time.
Had chicken bacon ranch pizza and watched "Top Gun: Maverick" It was a very enjoyable film. It felt stream lined, no unnecessary drama or sex scenes or any of that junk. It didn't have a terribly complicated plot but it sure had enjoyable thrills. Well toned gluts from all the edge of seat sitting and butt cheek clinching. 
### January 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Some time alone with Megan.
2. Progress at work
3. A warmish day.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Arranged for us to have some private time.

Entry

Yesterday I chipped away at preview deployments. I was feeling a little aimless and like I didn't know what to do. But fortunately I was able to think through the problem and get myself moving.
After work I exercises and listed to "Playing to Win." which is actually a management book and as far in that direction as I care to go right now. I want to get back to coding and coding adjacent books. But it as I was lifting weights it was a good reminder of doing it's titular activity: Play to win. In this case, how strong is my motivation for lifting weights? What is my objective? With the vaugely defined "be healthy" and "make numbers go up." I do indeed find it hard to be motivated. So perhaps I should set some concrete goals that can inspire more motivation. 
After exercise we had supper and then we walked Lucy over to Amanda's for the evening. We lounged, showed, and had some intimate time. We discussed role playing something but decided against it on short notice. Though I think we've decided on a role play for next time we have the evening to our selves. Walked back to Amanda's and picked Lucy up. She fell asleep in the wagon on the way home. I managed to get her ready for bed except for her teeth. We decided we really needed to do her teeth since she had just had cookies at Amanda's. This of course woke her up as she is much more sensative to things in her mouth than she was previously to our dismay. But we eventually calmed her down and she watched little worship company and then came and cuddled and then went back to little worship company and fell asleep.
### January 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A seller who seems willing to work with me on the server issue
2. Little plants that are growing.
3. A happy little Lulu

Thing I love about Megan: 
Reads to Lucy

Entry

Yesterday I did a fair bit of good work. I'm inching very close to having the deploy pipeline ready to roll. I'm just trying to smooth the transition as much as possible at this point. 
After work I fiddled with the server some more. I was in contact with the seller during the day and he recommended checking if there was a cpu in the socket. Both sockets had CPUs and niether appeared to have bent pins. I also tried several boot media to no avial yesterday. So unless the seller has some stellar idea for debugging at this point I'm looking to send it back.
Then I went up stairs and read the crayon man book to Lucy and we watched a pair of "how it's made" segments. Then we had supper. We got Lucy ready for bed then Lucy and I played Resturant after supper for a little then we played some mario kart. Then Lucy played Rain on my parade, then she played little mousy game and finally she settled down for some Ada Twist. We had been expecting her to fall asleep at any moment, hence getting her ready for bed earlier. Finally at 9ish she fell asleep and I continued work on the hyvee budget automation. Watched Star Trek:TOS and went to bed.
### January 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A gracious seller on ebay
2. Hope for a new server
3. Great progress on harness

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages me

Entry

Yesterday was an exciting day. I spent most of the day working on a script to migrate our github webhooks from org wide to repo wide. I can now swap around the webhooks with great ease. It's neat. By the end of the day I removed the webhook hurtle, and it went flawlessly. So now the way is clear for me to begin the migration of microservices to the new pipeline.
After work I went down to exercise and around that time the seller on ebay got back to me about my server. We had an exchange, which really slowed down my exercise time, in which we agreed that I'd send back the server I have and buy a new one from him. Hopefully this new one will work like a charm and I can get on with setting up server stuff and migrating our media over to it. 
After exercise we had supper and then I played with Lucy alittle before I settled down to work on the budget. I got the automation of hyvee aisles online done. At least for december. That's great news as that catchup task was taking a very long time. But it also has set a decent example of how to do xpath based scrappers in the future whch is nice. 
Having had success with the automation I decided to join Megan and Lucy on a walk. Snow was coming down fairly heavily but in very small flakes. It was very beautiful out side. 
Played Valheim with Ben. We are working our way up the unique resources of the mistlands. We are now at a point of building a base to leverage some of said resources. This is generally my favorite time. I'm in my happy place when I'm building functional buildings. Like the stair case I build a few weeks back, that was fun. 
### January 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A new server coming in the mail
2. Gratuity parts from the dead server
3. Fun games, video and regular, last night

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is really pretty good at video games these days

Entry

Yesterday I started the migration of HQE and hammered out some bugs. After lunch I attempted to do like wise with Billing-Audit and Billing but I couldn't get any QA so they had to be put on hold. Hoping to push them out today but an outage over night has put a freeze on new deployments.
I took a mid morning break to blow the snow off the drive way. It was pretty intense. The snow plows had all but filled the gap in the embankment at the end of the drive way, that required me to lift the snow blower and use it like a plane to trim down the bank until it was low enough for the van to get over. When I cleared the side walk there were spots deeper than the snow blower and so I have a picture of said snow blower looking like a submarine traveling through the snow with just it's spout visible above the snow.
After work I urged supper along so I could get to handball on time. I got the new r420 replacement server ordered and it should be on its way today. Had supper. Then I gathered snow pants and boots and brought them with me in the car to handball just in case I needed something more significant than my shorts since we had gotten about a foot of snow. It was delightful and the streets were largely cleared by the time I got out. The hand ball was flat and I had forgotten to bring my pump so we were SOL on the hand ball front. We played Dodgeball tag instead. It wasn't amazing but it kept us busy for an hourish. Got some exercise.
Played more skyward sword. We got through the second trial and got what I'm going to certainly always call the hook shot. We can finally navigate the targets we've seen all over the blood place. Got to the sand sea and got through the skipper's retreat puzzle. Headed to bed.

Friday I worked on metrics since deployments were frozen by an outage that occured over night. Made some good progress.
After work I did my exercise and then I closed out the budget. By the time it was all done Lucy started watching a show so I decided to relax with a game. I wasn't likely going to be able to focus on anything at that point anyway.
Saturday morning comes and I made chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast. Megan goes off to help with the lunch following a funeral and I go down stairs to start cleaning the basement. Brady calls while I'm doing such and I chat with him for an hour and a half while I'm reorganizing the basement. It is unfortunate that I didn't get any before and after pictures. The change in the drone room is quite remarkable. It is now two rooms, the store room (with kitty cove and printer corner) and Lucy's play room. I even got the side table for the guest room painted. I worked on that basically until Megan came home and so had a really late lunch. Napped. Read for a little, made love, read some more. Eventually it was time for supper, which I helped with. After supper I showed Lucy, managed to get her to shower quite quickly by picking her up in the shower to get her to rinse her hair. Then I relaxed a bit in the shower and then played evil genius for a bit before bed. 
Sunday we go to church. It was a good sermon. I'm in the middst of struggling over the facts of eternity. Fear that I might be wrong. And hearing Solomon struggle through some of this nihilism is good. Over all I feel like the two places I'm likely to go are either Atheism or Catholisism. And by pascal's wager, there is no reason to be an athiest, if I'm wrong and the athiest is right there is not that has been lost. And based on my understanding of catholosism I think I'm pretty good on that front too. Based on my experiences and the available information I do think I am making the most reasonable decission in my current choice of religion. But my heart still fears. And to a certain extent I do think that is good. It is a sign of humility. 
After church I ran to runnings and picked up a gun locker so we can finally secure our fire arm, and potentially fire arms, and ammo. I played evil genius until it was time to pick up Megan. We had lunch. I took a nap. Played evil genius until Lucy drove us absolutely bonkers at which point we want out side to play on the giant snow mountain. I carved a new sled slope for Lucy. After about an hour we were spent and it was time to make supper.
We were going to watch caddy shack but the disc wasn't playing. So we watched an episode of abstract with Lucy driving us nuts. Eventually she fell asleep and we were able to watch our show in peace.
### January 24th

1. Lots of fun for Lucy

Yesterday was fast and furious and fantastic. Got 6 out of 7 delta micro services migrated over to the new harness deployment pipeline. Now we can move on to the other team's micro services.
After work I skipped exercise since I was out with Lucy on the snow mountain on sunday. I was also pretty tired. But after maybe half an hour of attempting to rest I gave in to Lucy and played with her till supper. She really wanted some one to play with clearly. After supper I tried to read the Kanban rule book but Lucy was being very distracting, not to mention "how it's made" was being very distracting too. Eventually I went to the other room to try to read the booklet. It's a lot of rules, it's taking a while. I didn't finish last night.
### January 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Giant Pile o' Snow!
2. Progress on harness stuff
3. A world where people don't die very often.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes fun crafts

Entry

Yesterday was the first day of "move everybody everywhere to new harness." and unfortunately the enthusiasm was low and only 1 and a half services out of the remaining 14 got moved. :\
After work Lucy and I played on the snow mountain till she was tired then we played with her babies inside until supper. After supper I finished reading the Kanban rule book in preparation for playing the game tonight. We'll see how well it goes, there are a lot of things to that game.
Then I did my exercise. I have put aside "playing to win" and started reading "Crime and Punishment" which I borrowed from the library. 
I Changed my life insurance beneficiaries to be Megan and Lucy marking another task off of my todo list. At that point Lucy started watching "How it's Made" videos and there wasn't much time left in the evening so I started playing Evil Genius. I've finally revealed the final objectives for the first island and am now trying to finish them. I finished one of the three but ran out of time last night. This weekend though I should finish the first island. I think I'm going to play until I beat the game once. I think I'll have had my fill by then.
We watched "Trials and Tribil-ations" last night. The DS9 call back to TOS, since we had just watched "troubles with tribils" the night before. It was impressive how much they recreated in order to pull that episode off.
### January 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My Job
2. Interesting board games
3. A warm house

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes playing games

Entry

Yesterday was a bit hectick. But I managed to work with Shane to get through almost all the team Next servics onto the new harness deployment pipeline. At the same time I was working on fixing cronjobs which went well enough. I discovered a bug in harness that barriers don't work inside of repeats. 
After work I skipped exercise because Megan wasn't feeling the greatest so I made supper instead. After supper I took Lucy to Cubbies while Megan read the rules to Kanban. We didn't get all the way through even I think a quarter of the game. But we got through a fair bit and I think it will provide insight we need to be able to get further in two weeks when we try again. We might even be able to finish a game. I think it will go decently quick once we've got the idea of the game. 
Megan left to pick up Lucy and I cleaned up the game. It needs more baggies. Then I played Evil Genius for a bit while waiting for Ben. I finished the objectives for the first Island so this weekend I'll be able to move to the new island. I think it's relatively straight forward and open ended once I get to said locale. I'll also be able to start picking off the Super agents which will make my life a little better. 
Played Valheim with Ben. We are now working our way to the next objectives. I've built us a little base on our mistlands island. I built the base in the plains but near the mist lands so we can raise crops near the base. There is also a number of roots near the base that we'll be able to tap. It was a good night though a glitch seems to have caused items to disappear. Most notably our black forge has disappeared. This is quite troublesome. We already were short the number of black cores we needed and now 5 of them just disappeared. So I'm going to try to hack more into our possession. Troublesome.
This morning I found out Justin has been promted to Dev4. I'm still a Dev2 and was hoping I would have some over lap with Justin since he's 5 years younger than me. There are definitely parts of me that feel like my time at USD stunted my growth. And I felt a pang of jelousy over Justin's promotion. I will talk with Todd about it today and see where I am supposed to put information to make my case. 
### January 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Contining progress on harness
2. Games for exercise
3. A new server in the mail

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is warm and cuddly

Entry

Made great progress yesterday. After seeking out Optim we got moving on two services and also got Victory done. Despite having horrid deployment issues all throughout the day un-related to what I was doing. 
After work I took a short nap with Lucy and then tried to wake her for supper. After supper I had a little time before hand ball so I went down and examined my new server. Zero drive cadies, disappointing, but most notable the "32gb" ram advertised was not there, instead I got 4gb of ram. I'm going to take a closer look at the machine tonight but that's not starting off on a good foot.
Went to hand ball, there were 7 people including Kinley last night. It was all fun and games till devon rolled his ankle this week.
Came home and played Skyward sword. I was thinking I would do one area and then Megan would do the next and it just ended up being a very long area. I think she was fine with it though. 
### January 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An immune system
2. A relaxing weekend
3. Another coating of snow

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is working to figure out why the miscarriages keep happening.

Entry

Friday was rougher than I wanted but it did complete with all the Microservices migrated. I'm going to wait till wednesday to start tearing down the existing pipeline as it will be invalid at that point anyway. 
After work I did my exercise I started working on the new server. It took some doing but I got it up and running and started transferring files from the external drive into the new raid 1 array in the NAS. 
Saturday was rather low key. Lucy was coming down with sickness so we tried to keep things pretty low key to help her heal quickly. I spent some time thinking about my personal website and I think I have decided on a way forward. I'm going to stick with Pelican for now, but if I get frustrated I'm going to drop down to frozen flask. The real work is going to be the actual formatting of the webpage. I also mopped the floors that morning and tend to other bits and bobs, most notably got the remaining kitchen cabinet painted in primer. Played video games and more LoZ in the evening since we were all stating to feel pretty spent.
Sunday comes and we stayed home from church and just streamed it. We were not yet all feeling like garbage but it was coming. After lunch I blew out the snow in the drive and we went on a short walk till Lucy complained about the cold. We came back and relaxed all afternoon. We watched "Lost City" and by the time we got to the movie Megan and I were down for the count. We went to bed early last night and had a pretty aweful night's sleep.
### January 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Relatively quick recovery from this cold.
2. Fidelity taking care of transfer from SDRSSRP (hopefully).
3. A fairly relaxed day.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages rest.

Entry

Yesterday I pounded my head against a wall. I was trying to get updating services in harness to work via a bash script and I just was having no luck getting it to behave. I'm going to switch to python today.
After work I skipped exercise since we are all sick. I painted the kitchen cabinet again, just 2 more passess and that project will be done. Huzzah! Transfers from Old Bragi to the new media drive in Udgard are still going a pace. I think last I saw over 2 Tibi bytes had been transferred. It's copying down now the 300gb that I backed up off of tellurium when I moved to windows. Last night I discovered something I'm missing from that move: The presets I have started currating for ultimaker cura. After supper I tried to go out and buy some Cinnamon Whiskey, but I could not for the life of me find my keys. With no keys I gave up on the endevour and sat down to read the dragon book. I'm hoping I'll be able to finish the chapter I am on tonight. A good time of sickness activity. 
Which also, the sickness is healing fairly quickly. Using the oxymetazoline hydrocholride as a nasal deconjestant is great. Not only is my nose not running it is open and feels great! Today I'm feeling pretty good so I am hopeful that I'll be able to kick this illness soon, maybe even by tomorrow morning I'll be back to feeling normal.
### February 1st

3. A sharp brain

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a strong Christian

Entry

Yesterday I made progress on a couple of things. But there were moments where I felt like I was fielding a thousand questions a minute. In reality it was just 2 maybe 3 people at a time for 5ish minutes at a time but never the less when you are carrying on two conversations at once it feels frantic.
After work the transfer of old bragi to new bragi had completed and I could plug it back into Alfheim. Huzzah! Inching closer to a final system. I then did my exercise as I felt better enough and hoped exercise would be good for my body. I gave the cabinet another coat of paint and went up to have supper. 
After supper was Papa time. Lucy had lost a sheet of stickers into the return vent in the hallway so I showed her taking off the vent and reaching into the duct to retrieve said sheet. We then played Mario kart with the expectation that she would fall asleep as she seemed to hint she was tired during supper time. But she didn't end up falling asleep till our bed time. I did a couple odds and ends in the evening, including filling out the form for a vanity plate. We are going to get plates that say "Urbosa" to go with our van. Nice!
Right now we have the guest bed in our bed room and when Lucy comes in in the middle of the night to sleep with us I move over to that bed. This results in a better night's sleep for all involved. 
### February 2nd

1. A month porn free
2. An ever analyical mind

Takes good care of Lucy

Entry

Yesterday was continued clean up from the harness migration. I think I've got most things now. I'm sure little bits will still show up here and there. And I prepared for the harness overview I gave this morning which went rather well. Though I could have done a better job bulletizing my talking points so I could remember things and refference them easier.
After work I went down stairs and put the final coat of paint on the last kitchen cabinet. Been sitting around for years waiting for this and I finally got it done. Huzzah! I might see if I can touch up some of the panels in the kitchen before I clean the brush. Hopefully this weekend we can get that cabinet hung.
Then I exercised and we had supper. I fiddled around with my new flower pots a little. In the morning when I came down they had leaked all over the top of the printer. None of the water damaged the printer thankfully but it clearly meant these pots weren't quite ready for prime time. I tried calking the bottom of one but it leaked still. It turns out there is a joint that the slicer doesn't see as connected and so a tiny gap exists. I used my soldering iron to try to weld that gap and got a great deal of improvement but some problems persist. I think I'll re-design the pot.
Played Valheim with Ben. It never fully crashed but we had some pretty hard freezes during play. We finally got a eitr refinery up so we are making our way through the mistlands. We should be able to start building mistlands armor next week.
### February 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Recovering from illness
2. Signs Lucy is listening
3. Scripture

Yesterday I gave a presentation on the overview of harness, it went pretty well. Then I hammered on the mover murder issue until I got it working. I didn't end up taking the afternoon off as Jason and Laura's flight was delayed a day due to freezing rains. Happens.
After work I went down stairs and did my exercise with Lucy's assistance of course. She was annoying Megan so Megan was all to happy to brush her off onto me. After exercise we made supper. I then ran around the house doing various little chore since Lucy was in a really helpful mood. We did all of my monthly chores: water harp, water basement drain, clip cat's claws, replace litter in litter box. It was cute but there was not a lot she could do to help me with the budget. Which I then did till video game time. But in that interveneing hour Lucy fell apart. We asked her to do some simple tasks and she refused so we told her no video game night and no candy. She cried in her room and eventually came down and said maybe she could just watch and we said she could if she would pick up her craft box, she tried to wiggle out of it but we held fast and so back up to her room she went. She cried for a while again and then she came back down and asked for hugs and kisses and after some pushing we got her to agree to pick up her craft box. She also reported that is was scary to be in her room alone. This was encouraging I feel like this was the first time we've taken disciplinary action and she has eventually bended to our will. This is the start of her learning to control herself. 
### February 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun places to go
2. Buffets!
3. Warm days

Thing I love about Megan: 
Pushes me to get outside. 

Entry

Friday was a bit of a catastrophe. We tried to push the change to client api that would starve the movers so they may be murdered. But it failed. The reason was not clear at first but frustrating once I found it. Old data in redis was still there and still malformed. So we have put that off to next work day.
After work I did my exercise and worked on the budget. Not a lot of note. 
Saturday we went to a park outside Hawarden. It was kinda fun trudging through the snow. There was some fairly deep snow in spots. Lucy had fun. We went to Pizza Ranch for lunch afterwards and enjoyed the Buffet. I ate enough for both lunch and supper. In fact I was still feeling a little full the next morning. Mmm. Delightful. Worked on budget some more and finished my day with some Evil genius. 
Sunday came and I went to church early for rehearsal. I'm having a bit of a struggle in my self confidence as a sound board op as Derek seems to always be having to help me get little tweaks right. The positioning of the mic and the reduction of ringing. I wonder if he notices the couple of things that he has told me a couple of times. I also feel like things aren't sinking in. It feels like I just don't care enough. To be fair, sound board op is fairly low key and it's easy to get distracted.
I thought through what I need to do next in my efforts to migrate our server infrastructure and wireless. Creating priorities so that I have some guiding principals to keep me on track. I hope to start working on some of that this week.
After church I took my nap and rested for almost an hour, I must have been a little tired yet. I started the night in the side bed since we still have an extra bed in our room right now till everyone is feeling better. It has been working so well that we haven't felt a strong impetus to put the bed back. 
I played some more evil genius and finally got bored. There were enough things bothering me and I couldn't bring myself to put forth the effort. I want to move on to other games, I clocked 24 hours in evil genius after all. I'm going to play "Hollow Knight" next. I'm excited.
We watched Glass onion last night. The plot wasn't amazing but the story writing was very well done. Everything tied back in on itself very neatly. Basically every moment if the first act got revisited, nothing was thrown away. Made breafast Pizza.
### February 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An extra bed
2. New drive caddies
3. Budget automations coming together.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cuddles

Entry

Yesterday I mostly sat in on the process of the mover migration code being pushed to production. I didn't do much but I did serve as a advisery role during that meeting. Everything went smoothly. I was pleased. I tried to accomplish other things through the rest of the day but was not met with much success. Hopefully I can be a little more focused today.
After work Lucy assisted with my weight lifting like she likes to do. I don't like it much because it means I can't listen to an audio book or such at the same time. After that I fixed the certificate issues, which stemmed from DNS issues, on Alfheim and got Home Assistant back up and running. Then we had supper and I went about working on the budget. I got most of the budget done but noticed some issues in the hyvee receipts. I keep hoping that I can get these parsers stable and get good content out of them automatically. It's proving challenging but this change to XPATHs is encouraging. I hope to finish the budget tonight.
### February 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Completed budget
2. Lovely warm days. 
3. Interesting videos

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is curious

Entry

Yesterday I was fairly stymied by victory. For some reason the metrics I expect aren't showing up and I had no luck getting victory to run correctly on my local machine.
After work I exercised. I tried listening to Crime and Punishment but it is getting very dull. I'm several hours into the book and the inciting event has happened but now things are drawing out with a bunch of events that as yet seem unrelated. My loan of it expired last night so I'll have to wait two-ish weeks until it is back in my possession to continue. After that I might just try to marathon it to get through the book.
Then Lucy and I played some Mario Kart and some Legend of Zelda for papa time while we waited for supper. After supper I finished the budget. Megan tried to help me mount the r210 that is serving as our router soon but I was having no luck getting it to mount. It is only after the fact that I realized that the little black ears that come with the server are not meant to be the mounting brackets. So I will need to figure out something else. I then got TrueNAS Scale installed on udgard as a VM. This will serve as the file server going forward. So I'm inching towards my brave new world. I really ought to get that new access point ordered soon. 
### February 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Another lovely warm day.
2. A heart a peace.
3. A 3D printer

Thing I love about Megan: 
Discipline's Lucy

Entry

Yesterday I had a good go of things in the morning writing new code to deal with another mover issue that's keeping us from shutting down the movers. And then I banged my head on metrics. It sounds like Drake might be able to help me with metrics today, that's good. The big problem though is that I forgot I was supposed to be setting up a service for Micheal Miller and so I ended up blocking him all day because I forgot. Woops.
We had a picnic lunch in the snow. It was pretty nice. I of course didn't get my nap which was a little annoying but it happens. Megan had a tempertantrum Lucy to bring home, but she had all the time in the world so she just let Lucy throw her fits until she was ready to come home. It took them till like 3:30. But Lucy, who had been a royal pain all morning, was fairly well behaved most of the rest of the day. So we are going to keep leaning on the disciplinary approach to try to bring her to heel.
After supper I did my exercise quick and then we had supper quick and then Megan took Lucy to Cubbies. We tried Kanban once again got further this time. The game is starting to make sense, but we'll need a time to play the game without a time limit. Then Megan fetched Lucy from Cubbies and I sat down to do some computer stuff till it was time for Games with Ben. Inching progress in Valheim again. We finally have the next tier of armor though, that's good. We need to upgrade it yet and we want feather fall capes, but progress none the less.
### February 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My beloved
2. Fun games
3. A job where I work from home.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans fun vacations.

Entry

Yesterday wasn't to bad. I feel like I actually acomplished things, but not much of note. After work I fiddled with the r420 server and found that I had indeed broken the case sensor and so the server continued to think it was open. I glued that back together and everything was fine. We had supper and were going to all go to hand ball but Lucy was a screaming whining mess so I went by myself. 
Handball was interesting. It was our first night with Tom and he plays much more aggressively than the rest of us. The most halarious moment of the evening came at it's end when I ran towards the goal to try to score and Tom ran towards me from the goal to block me, he miss judged his jump and we collided mid air. I landed flat on my back and banged my elbow. Knocked the wind right out of me. I'm a little sore today but mostly good. 
After that I came home and we played Skyward sword for a while. We got most of the way through the fire sactuary. I think next week we'll get a lot of good stuff. The game has lagged a little story wise but it is nice that we haven't had the silliness of just missing zelda 3 more times. We are about to pick the story line back up though so I'm excited for next week.
### February 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D printer
2. An enjoyable story (Reading "the goal")
3. A restful weekend.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys snack foods

Entry

Friday wasn't to bad. But I have growing concerns about whether all is sunny in the world of OTEL. I need to do some deep thinking yet.
After work I did my exercise and sat down to fiddle with the new server stuff. I'm getting ready to start working on switching us over, hopefully in the near future. Started playing "Hollow Knight."
Saturday morning I made pumpkin scones and did various things. Most of my attention is on the server stuff right now. We went on a walk to put Lucy to sleep, which worked, and then after the walk we spent a good deal of time talking about gardening. We have lots of exciting plans now for our back yard. Forget about grass! We are going to plant lots of plants! We are going to make sheltered areas for Lucy to play in and just enjoy being in nature rather than nothing but grass which we've got to keep in prestine condition. We are going to go whole hog and have plans for tearing up a full third of our back yard. Should be exciting. Got a hair cut, played some hollow knight.
Sunday morning Lucy was sick so we stayed home from church. I was feeling it a bit to so I wasn't complaining. In the afternoon I played Hollow Knight for a little while and then I started cleaning the basement looking desparately all over the place for my black rj45 keystones. No luck. So I ended up just buying new ones. I'm trying to put together in my head everything I need to do now before we do the change over and this reworking of the physical network is certainly part of that. 
We had snack foods: wings, motzarella sticks, and breaded green beans for supper and watched top gun maverick again. Amanda was over so she was our excuse. 
### February 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hugs
2. Books
3. Servers

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of me and Lucy

Entry

Yesterday did not go as planned. I wanted to have time to think about metrics but when I was asked to quickly make a service I thought "Yea, sure, no problem" but it ended up being a trap. There was much more that needed to be done than setting up the service. This foobarred my whole day.
After work I did my exercise. Megan and Lucy were out side so I managed to get through most of my exercise before Lucy came home and insisted on helping me. Thank goodness. She really slows it down. Turns my half hour into closer to an hour. I spent most of the evening hacking away at home lab. I got nginx up and running as a reverse proxy, one important detail check. Now I am attempting to get certificates to work. I'm trying to do this via DNS so that I don't have to expose this server until I am ready to make it the main server. That's where I got stumped last night. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it tonight.
### February 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Coworkers to chat with about tech stuff
2. A nice warm house
3. A hot wife

Thing I love about Megan: 
Made an adorable valentines day dinner

Entry

I was supposed to figure out doing npm auth on github yesterday but instead was figuring out why npm wasn't building locally, it was frustrating. Justin got me over the hump but I was basically out of my time boxed time by the time that happened. Frustrating. And then working with Shane to test my PR didn't work, we don't know how Mark tests these things so we were pretty stuck.
After work I exercised and then fiddled with certs until Megan said supper was ready. She made all of supper into little hearts, it was precious. Then Lucy and I played for "papa time" or in this case it could be thought of as my date night with Lucy for Valentine's day. After that Megan and I gave each other backrubs and enjoyed each other's company. I finished off the evening with a little more cert fiddling and managed to get cert bot to give me certificates for my domain! Now I just need to figure out how to use them. 
### February 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Docker
2. Just a little more winter to make me ready for spring
3. Days getting brighter.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a good litarary critique.

Entry

Yesterday was a bit of a bust. We were queueing up to deploy the PR when I asked John a sanity check question: Does the user have write access to that table on that database? The answer, yes, however, that table is not on that database. WOW! That was an outage about to happen. Glad we dodged that bullet but it did mean I had to rework my code. Didn't take long but we have put off the deployment to today. We also had a conversation about metrics at the end of the day when I gave my findings.
After work I did my exercise and started plucking away again at certificates and proxying. I got my server to come up with certs and then got the services to come up behind them. I was pleased. Homeassistant was still behaving very strangely but I think that is an issue of the front end trying to cheat DNS. So I'm hoping when I do the migration this weekend it will actually go rather smoothly.
Played Valheim with Ben last night. It was mostly a chores night. We gathered some silver and surtling cores and chains. unfortunately the island that we went to to hunt fullings was already cleared so there wasn't any more black metal to be had. A near by island might cover that need for us though. We are also going to try building up our iron supply while we are at it as we have slowly worn through that as well. I rather enjoy the evenings spent doing chores at times. It feels much more progressive.
### February 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun games

3. Success at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Her faith encourages mine.

Entry

Yesterday we finally did it. So far as anyone has noticed the movers are done moving. Success! Huzzah! Now on to metric issues.
After work I didn't do exercise since it was a rehearsal night. I did however start working on my rack a bit. I have the key stones and the jumper cables so it was just an issue of starting to move all the plugs. By the time I was done I had only moved one of the runs into it's permanent location because I kept terminating the plug wrong. But I finally got it and now I can start migrating others over as soon as I enter the device on the other end of the run's MAC into the DHCP tables.
Went to rehearsal which went fairly quickly, gave me time to step outside and see if I could spot star link, no such luck. Came home and we played Skyward Sword. Beat a pair of bosses. Story is starting to pick up but I think it will mostly pick up the next evening we play as that evening will include us opening the portal of time. But we have the master sword now! The sword of infamey has been crafted!

Can push herself some times.

Entry

Friday fixed a long standing bug for HQE and mucked around in metrics. After work I exercised. After that I attempted to get the new AP up and running but was annoyed to see it was not flashed like it claimed to be. This gave me a moment of pause and I was concerned about bricking it. So I sent a message to the seller and reddit and did other preperatory things for the great network change over. I jambed my toe coming up the stairs at one point, so if my toe nail does the weird nail under nail thing again, this was likely the source. 
Saturday morning comes and I make us donuts and chat with Brady in the morning. We then left for Mead Lumber to look at windows and try to finally decide which ones we want to do. We are leaning towards Anderson windows but we're waiting to see what an updated quote will look like. We then had lunch in Yankton and went for a walk in the park. We chatted about the windows during such.
Came home, I took a nap, fiddled with other preparations for the network hand over while I waited for Megan to be off the network. The ebay seller came through and instructed me how to flash the AP, never did get a response from reddit. Finally, it was time, did the change over and it didn't work at first. Silly me, plugged one end of the cable into the ONT but didn't plug the other into the router. Once I did that everything came on line and pieces started to click into place. Huzzah! Success! We are officially off of ISP provided hardware. This process also involved moving to a new homeassistant instance and so I frantically tried to get everything up and running in HA again. Didn't get it all but got the important bits I think. Things have been moving smoothish since then. I've got a lot to do yet but I've now got a great foundation to work from. 
Sunday comes and I'm running sound. After church we drive off right away to go meet up with Dave and Tonya and Sam who is appearently staying a long weekend there. We met in Sioux City to go to the "Launch Pad" which is a smaller version of the Omaha Children's Museum. It was fun. I chased Sam around the climbing area to his great delight. Dad got a few videos of such.
We came home and were all very tired. I was going to play hollow knight but didn't feel the energy. So instead I played "town scapper". Not really a game, more of a toy or doodle pad. It is kinda fun. But it was time to do the sunday stuff. I cleaned the kitchen and made supper. We didn't feel like a movie so we watched "That time I got reincarnated as a slime" and then I played "Twon Scapper" with Lucy. She took to the game well. We think it will go a long way to teaching her to manipulate things in 3d on a 2d screen.
### February 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Home automation
2. Lucy napping
3. One more winter storm brewing!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Yesterday was a lot of mucking around in metrics in various ways. It was a pretty good day.
Afterwork I did my exercise. Lucy was napping so I got through my exercise relatively promptly. I spent most of the evening working on home assistant things. Getting some of the basic automations we are used to back. Getting old alfheim accessible for data extraction, etc. I think I need to set home assistant aside for a little bit though and deal with some of the other things, like external access, next. 
### February 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun new zigbee gizmos!
2. One more hurrah for winter!
3. Townscaper

Thing I love about Megan: 
Lets me do all my crazy home automation stuff. 

Entry

Yesterday at work I wore my brain out thinking about metrics all day. It was exhausting. (today I have a head ache so I'm hoping to find something less intense).
After work it was Lulu time. We played some Townscaper and read books. Then supper time. We cleaned up after supper so Lucy could watch shows when the timer went off. But the most notable part of yesterday was the arrival of my order from itead! 6 buttons, 4 window/door sensors, 3 temp+humidity sensors, and one motion sensor. I had a lot of fun setting them up and then all the automations to go with them. We now have buttons on our night stands to control the lights there, Lucy has a button to control her fairy lights and her overhead light. The kitchen has a button replacing my old UK phone at LOOOOOOONG last. We have a thermometer in the deep freeze and the upright freezer and one in Lucy's room. It was a lot of fun setting these things up. I've still got 2 buttons in reserve. Don't know what I'll do with them but they are nice to have on hand. It is also kind of nice that the buttons don't need to be attached to anything, they are effectively remotes.
I had to pause part way through my adventure to go do my exercise downstairs lest I forget or it get pushed to late in the day. After exercise and button playing I finally got back to trying to figure out how to get my homeassistant instance externally accessible. I'm not having any luck yet but I have managed to get librespeed working. Frustration.
### February 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Help from reddit
2. A chance for intimacy
3. Time for thinking

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys cuddling together.

Entry

I did a lot of thinking yesterday and I think it is beginning to pay off. We'll see what comes of it over the next few days/weeks.
After work I did my exercise, went and woke up Lucy, and other little bits. I tried to get homeassistant working externally but I was still having no luck. It turns out it might be a forwarding issue with my nginx reverse proxy. Some one on reddit recommended that and it sounds very plausible. I will attempt the recommended fix this evening. Other than that played some more valheim with Ben. Mostly did chores. But we are building some serious steam at this point. Our food supplies have been re-stocked, our metals are nearly there, we have a lot of refined eitr. It's all going well. So next week we will hopefully finish up the metal quest and begin traveling to the queen's island where we can finish the search for black cores and begin preparing for the queen.
### February 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lovely weekend
2. Bedtime returning to normal
3. Home network things clicking into place.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me.

Entry

It would seem I didn't journal friday. Woops. In terms of work, both days I did about the same thing: Worked on scaffolder changes and documentation. After work on Thursday play hand ball, played Zelda. We didn't get as far in Zelda as we were hoping. We kinda just started because of some delays in getting to it. Hopefully we can get a little further this week. Friday after work I went downstairs and did my exercise and finished "The Goal". Good book. That evening I mostly worked on the reverse proxy forwarding issue and finally got things working on homeassistant. Home assistant is now externally accessible. Success!
Saturday comes and I work on a number of smaller things. Mostly I was trying to get the data transferred so it was more accessible to TrueNAS. I got hugely stymied by weird permissions issues. In the end I just ended up copying using my local machine and the SMB shares as a way to strip strange permissions issues. Played some hallow night. Starting to get to an enjoyable state in the game. Not to self: If I make a metrovania mobility is an important ability to unlock early. Now that I have dashing (in place of double jump) and wall jumping I'm enjoying the game much more. Also reduced visibility that you are expected actually trudge through is super annoying. Don't do it.
Sunday was pretty relaxed. But also productive. After church I played some hallow knight till it was time to go pick Megan up. Then I did some gmail migration. Everything in bitwarden is now either marked as "Depricate" or "in progress". I'll be able to mark that as done here soon. Then it will be another task to clean up all the deprecated items. Played more hollow knight until it was time to prepare supper. We had cheese pizza and watched Paw Patrol. It was pretty good. Better than I would expect from a show to sell toys. And had a definite libertarian streek in it.
### February 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Several tasks done last night
2. FreeCAD
3. Developing patience

Thing I love about Megan: 
is encouraging.

Entry

Yesterday I spent most of the day preparing my review video. I was nearly done when 5 o'clock rolled around. Shouldn't take me to long to finish up today. I made a little harness (because my work this cycle was mostly about harness.io). I am intentially being a little forward thinking with these costumes. I want to be able to re-use these costumes later should I ever need them, and in doing so hopefully build up a collection that I can re-use later to speed up videos in the future.
After work Lucy was napping so I snuck downstairs to do my exercise. I felt kind of bad about this after the fact. What is letting Lucy join me for my exercise once a week? I don't want her to feel like she can't trust me (i.e. I'll sneak around her) and I don't want her to not trust taking a rest (e.g. if I take a rest things will happen and I'll miss out!). So I talked with her afterwards and told her I would wake her next week if she was napping and she could come help me do my exercise. It's only a phase anyway. 
The evening I spent mostly working on the cases for the Distributed Nodes, or DNodes. I have found FreeCAD to be fairly good for me. There are certainly things that bug me about it, but it is working fairly well for all my needs so I'm pretty happy with it. I was able to design the whole case last night, but I had to wait till this morning to get it printed. It is currently doing such. After I designed the case I also compiled the retirement info and started thinking about what needs to be put in the firesafe. It was a pretty productive evening.
We have been playing the "monster" game every night for getting Lucy ready for bed for a few weeks now. It has worked so well that we are several days past picking a short bedtime show and still haven't had reason to do such. Lucy happily plays along. The monster can see her until she's in her PJs, smell her till she brushes her teeth, and hear her until she is in bed. We have adapted and changed it over time. Now she also has a sword and shield because she wanted to fight the monster. She fights us off and runs to the bathroom the brush her teeth. Doing her mouth was was getting to be challenging so now she has to do her mouth wash to re-charge her sword and shield. It's getting a bit elaborate (we limit her to one monster slaying per night) but it still is much faster than fighting her all the way and she is happy during it all. So it is well worth. 
She slept the entire night in her bed for the first time in a long time. It was delightful. Someday I'll get over the ridiculous wondering if she stopped breathing during the night being the reason she hasn't come to our bed. xD
### March 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Music
2. Time with Lucy
3. A project coming together

Thing I love about Megan: 
is a prize worth striving for.

Entry

Yesterday I finished up my review video and then I worked on documentation. We had our end of cycle team celebration game time as well. We played star craft and things went pretty well.
After work I wanted to see how my prints for the node cases went. During the morning my first attempt finished but it had a number of flaws. I thought I was going to have to wait till the end of the day to make tweaks, but then I realized I just needed to tweak some numbers and BAM! new case! Using proper CAD software instead of using blender is a huge improvement. Even if FreeCAD can be janky at times. So I started that print and it was done before the end of the day. So after work I got it off the printer and test fitted it. There were a couple problems but a little tweaking got me past most. I had to print a new lid though and that took an hour. I also printed a usb to dupont adapter that I just used bar cables and some glue to afix and power the nodes. But because of the glue I had to wait till this morning. It technically assmbled but I wasn't happy with the result. It was the basement node so that was ok. The case doesn't close is the biggest issue. So this evening I will make some changes and print a new version for the next node, probably the garage. 
Lucy and I did crafts, played in a blanket and then made music for papa time last night. I need to get a little better about not jelously guarding my time from Lucy. When I put it that way it feels obsurd that I want to keep my time with her boxed in so I can fiddle with my nodes and do my exercise. My struggle is she usually suggests relatively boring things. Or things that take a lot of energy from me. But I'm her Papa and she's my little one, and I'll never have these years of her life back. She's the only child I've got and I have no garuntee that I'll have more or that I'll have her for even another second or her me. That matters a bit more than tinkering. 
### March 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. So much time for leisure.
2. My little lulu
3. A heart that is turning more to God.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is crafty.

Entry

Yesterday was the cycle review. Followed by working on finishing up a client api change (redis password) that has been dangling since October. Hopefully it will get merged today. Then I did other cool down things.
After work I did my exercise and worked on printing some more things for my DNodes. This morning I finished up the porch node. It is a bit improved from the basement one but it still has problems so I'm going to make a few more changes to refine it further. It needs to be a hair taller yet, and I would like to improve the way the slot knotches work, particularly I would like to improve things a bit so I can print with supports to keep that chanel nice as clean. But I think also making the channel bigger than 1 mil will help with that. 
Play Valheim with Ben. We tackled a pair of Fuling camps and gathered more black metal. By the end of the evening I was sailing a boat full of Metal to our base, but I didn't quite get there before the end of the session. However that means I'll be pulling into our base at the beginning of next session and we'll get straight away into refining it. OH darn, I just realized we forgot the silver. 
### March 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun exercise.
2. Spring a coming!
3. Excitement for gardening this coming year.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants to do lots of gardening this year

Entry

Yesterday did lots of things. but most importantly got a PR that has been dangling in client API since October merged. Huzzah!
After work I hacked away on my dnode case trying to make it just a little bit nicer. The result will take 5 hours now to print so I was unable to print it last night, I have started such this morning. We played 4 square last night so it was a little less intensive that hand ball. It did not involve anywhere near as much running. 
We got some good time clocked into Zelda last night. We got through 3 stages. We have about 5 left to finish the game. I think we should be able to finish it before the end of the year.
### March 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forethought in making backups
2. Warm weather returning
3. Home assistant coming together again.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys intimacy too.

Entry

Friday on various things as the cooldown week draws to a close. After work I did my exercise. I'll be happy when we get back to spring and I do running instead of stationary biking. It is, as Brady said, remarkably boring. And the nature of it is there is not much to measure. Hopefully by next year I'll have a bike computer and I'll be able to measure distance on the trainer. 
After that I worked on another Node. This time the garage. I also started fiddling with batteries and managed to fry the ada fruit feather that I bought for this express purpose. *sigh* So I have ordered another one. 
Saturday morning comes and I make Rhubarb muffins. We go off to the Lumber Yard LLC to look at what windows they have there. Andersons, but also Gerkin. We discovered that the "window extension" on vynl windows can be wood which greatly increased Megan's willing ness to do vynl windows. And at 12k$ cheaper it is an up hill argument to convince me other wise. After that I stayed home with Lucy and fiddled with something in Home Assistant while Megan went to get a blood draw. Then I went to church for a teach team meet up and syncing session. It went a little long lasting until 2ish. I finally get home and do my chores. By the time I'm done with that my 4th node case has printed. I assemble the 4th node, which will go in our bedroom, and can officially consider myself done with that project. I still have a bare node in the study but that is largely becaue I don't know where else I would put it than on my desk and I kind of want to leave it open to some day maybe circle back to 433MHz networking. After that I flashed "midgard" into "alfheim" and with that I think that is the last computer to change. Huzzah! Though it took me longer than I hoped to get the zigbee network back on line. Eventually got it though. 
Sunday morning. Go to church. Return and I work on moving Alfheim down into the server rack. It doesn't have a proper rack mount yet so it is just sitting there right now. As is Muspelheim. Printing rack mounts for these devices has been a low priority. I then tried to get the weather station in and burned myself out the previous night trying to get things to behave. So I focused on just doing the dashboards for now. Got all the dashes and some scenes updated. Success. Returned to church for a missions team meeting. Returned home and setup the weather station using my previous script. I've decided I'll just refine that script and call it a day. It works well enough and is fairly straight forward. 
Then I finally relaxed for a little with some Hollow Knight. The game is growing on me as I play it more, which is nice. At first I was really unimpressed. I'm kind of bored of dark and broody games. 
Made Salmon pizza for supper. It was new, I enjoyed it. The ought salmon was hard to slice into ribbons like the recipe called for. Watched the Lego movie, which is such a great movie. Though Lucy gave up fairly early on in one of the action scenes as it was to scary. I am surprised at how sensitive she is to such. I had no realy idea how scary things could be for some one so small.
### March 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A pretty good night's sleep.
2. A completed budget
3. Time to think at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes Lucy on adventures.

Entry

Yesterday I had some more time to think about metrics at work. I'm trying to focus in on practical application at this point. In the afternoon I worked on attempting to process and upload metrics from logs. It went fairly well till I got stuck on uploading to influx. I'll try to figure that out today.
After work I napped a little with Lucy who was still resting after her and Megan's big day out adventuring at the Adams Homestead near Sioux City. This resulted in me not having time to exercise before supper. And then after supper I wanted to wait a bit. But I ended up forgetting until it was to late. But we did get the entire budget done last night. I timed myself this time to get some idea of how long each of the steps takes. If I can get the receipt automations stable I should be able to drop a full hour of work out of the budget. Never the less, 2.5-3h a month is not to bad in terms of total time to track all our monies.
### March 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Finishing my book
2. Snow to play with Lucy
3. Coming spring

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Yesterday I mostly worked on the log processing. I got it working to my great delight. Now I will let it sit and simmer and discuss it with co-workers while I spin up work on the other pitch: Uninstall notifications.
After work Lucy and I went outside and played on the snow mountain. It isn't very much fun now as it is getting rough and icy. It's less snow and more large ice crystals. But we never the less enjoyed being outside for a while. Lucy and I made a snow pile on our side walk because she wanted to. Walked around a bit, just kind of enjoyed being out side. 
Came in for supper. After supper I had 2.5h of a book left to read so I throw on an audio book and went downstairs to work on the under-stair cabinet. I could do that while I listened to said audio book. I also did my bike riding exercise while I was down there. I managed to get the larger of the two areas cleared out, cleaned, and a first layer of paint on the structure of it. The shelves I removed to the garage for a little pre-processing: they are super rough so I'm going to sand them a bit. I might try to also get to the smaller section of the understairs store area, but we shall see. I plan on also touching up the floor paint when I am done. But already, just a single layer of bright white has greatly improved the look of the unit. 
### March 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Board games
2. An emptied garage
3. Enjoyable evenings

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a strong Christian

Entry

Yesterday I got the first part of my uninstall notifications pushed. Then it was back to thinking about metrics and I really feel like we are spinning now. What do we do! I don't know. >.<
After work I exercised quick since it is a cubbies night. Then we had supper, I took Lucy to Cubbies. Megan and I played Agricola 2 player, then I did some fiddling with my Adafruit ESP32 feather. Having troubles getting it to be programmed. 
Then played Valheim with Ben. We are trying to push to the final objective, "The Queen." I got to her island and setup a portal in the plains but we have both died now several times trying to get to the spot. It is very annoying. We have 4 suits of armor out there now. >.<
### March 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Getting home safely.
2. My mom getting a place with Brady and Julie.
3. My remote job that allows me to be basically a stay at home dad.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is comforting during my spiritual warfare.

Entry

It looks like I missed friday journaling. Didn't miss much. Spun on metrics for a while during the day. After work played indoor ultimate frisbee and then played Zelda. We are getting very close to completing Zelda. This week? Probably not, next week? Quite probably. 3 more areas and the end.
Friday worked on getting push notifications to come from Client API. After work I did my exercise and spent some time time working on the under stairs shelving. Specifically I spackled a bunch of places to try to improve the look of it a fair bit. Tonight I plan to sand it. I was impressed by the strength the spackle has after it is painted, I might attempt to put spackling on some spots on the basement floor to try and smooth those out too. 
Saturday I made breakfast and then went to see Jose and chat about AI generated charts. Then I did some sanding on the shelves of the understairs shelves. Then we ate lunch, bathed, and prepared to head out to my Mom's. 
Spent the afternoon in Orange City. It was enjoyable. Covered some important will stuff with my Mom. When we drove home it was a bit harrowing. It was foggy so we had to slow down to 30 mph at points. The 55m drive took 90m. I was so tired when we got home. 
Sunday comes, we manage to roll our selves out of bed on time considering daylight savings. (Sounds like the legislature to end the change is up to bat again. COME ON CONGRESS! DO SOMETHING USEFUL FOR ONCE!) After church I talked with Derek about some of the stage equipment. I created a design to demonstrate my idea for how to remotely control the amps on stage from the booth when I got home and forwarded it to him. If he likes it I'll probably pass it by dustin or some one for further opinion. 
After church I pushed us through finishing our wills. We will hopefully get them all signed this Tuesday. Then I played hollow knight for a while till I got frustrated and decided to play some factorio instead. Started two death worlds, lost them both, went and made supper. We watched "Taken" for our movie that evening since Lucy is scared of everything, even the Lego movie right now. I need to fix Plex so she can watch her own movies while we watch ours. After the movie I started a game of Sea Block on factorio since it is a popular mod I had yet to play. Then it was time for bed.
Megan and I had time to be intimate. I pleased her but when it came to be my turn I couldn't focus. My spiritual distress came rearing up again and I told Megan all that was on my heart. Hopefully getting it out more throughly will have a positive effect on me. And hopefully seeing it for what it is, growing pains, is also going to be good. Dear lord almight I hope I can get to the point where I have peace in my heart while still maintianing my love for the Lord and desire to be with him. I was brought to tears talking about how scared I am that I'm hell bound (though not in those words). I stand by my statement that if this pain is what I need to get myself to be a better Christian than I don't want it to go away, but that doesn't mean it's enjoyable.
### March 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A productive evening
2. My cycle going well
3. More of my server stuff coming on line

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys intimacy

Entry

Yesterday was a good day. Though I felt rather aimless through a decent chunk of it. I was waiting for people on various facets. But I am approaching completion of one of my two pitches. Very nice.
After work I woke Lucy and did my exercise. She had told me to do such. She didn't help with my weights or counting since she was mostly asleep on the mat next to me. So it went fairly well. After that I fiddled with the samba server on Udgard until I got it working. I have decided to not use TrueNAS at all and just depend entirely on docker and docker-compose to run everything. TrueNAS was being troublesome and proved to be not helpful. This way I have everything setup in the same way except homeassistant which wanted to be it's on VM. I then started transfering movies as a proof of things working. 
After supper I went downstairs and started working on the understairs shelving again. Sanding down the spackling and then painting. It is a very complicated shape relatively speaking so painting took a while. I also had the shelves to paint. It was about 8:30 when I finished it all. 
When I returned upstairs I continued to fiddle with the server. This time I got Plex up and running. The movies finished transfering so I transferred all of bluey to get the shows starting. As a result I was able to show lucy a new Bluey when she was being trouble some about putting her PJs on. It was fun to see some new Bluey episodes after so long.
### March 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Most of my data safely backed up
2. Nearing completion of my recreation task
3. Interesting new challenges appearing at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has been encouraging adventurousness in our food.

Entry

Work went pretty well. I think I have finished up the Android Uninstall Notifications pitch, on the second day of the cycle no less. However, out of the blue came an issue with the old deployment system, frogger, so no time to rest my energies are being fully repointed at fixing that problem. 
After work Lucy wanted to do Papa time after Supper so I went down and did my exercise. Through out the night and day I had been transfering data off of the old Alfheim hard drive and neared completion by the evening. When I went to bed it was transfering audio books, I'll have to double check that all got transferred as windows decided last night to reboot and crash my virtual machine again. I need to figure out how to make windows not do that. (also, it might do that every tuesday. Perhaps I should find the pattern.) And now Alfheim's hard drive is un-readable. Thanks windows. I hope I've got everything else backed up enough that I won't have lost anything.
We played with Dominos for papa time. It was enjoyable. It was also pi day and we decided cheese cake is kind of like pie.
### March 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Completing tasks
2. Fun new challenges
3. Data durability.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is raising Lucy well.

Entry

Yesterday was an interesting day at work. I was rapidly attempting to replace our build system for a couple of legacy programs because our legacy build system croaked (haha, a pun, legacy build service was "frogger"). I made good progress yesterday and only had one minor issue.
After work I head down stairs and did my exercise. While I was down there I also reassembled the understairs shelves. I'm almost done with that task, I just need to "organize" them, what ever that means. Had supper. And then from supper to games with Ben I was attempting to get optical backups of my photots. I got the process sorted out but only had 1 dvd burned by the end of the day.
Play more Valheim. We recovered our armors and went spelunking. I got my first taste of magic, it was fun. I don't know how much longer we'll keep playing. We are now at the door of the next boss. Perhaps we'll upgrade our stuff a bit more before we dive in. 
### March 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Optical backups
2. A nice day inside
3. Spring coming

Thing I love about Megan: 
I sleepy like me some times.

Entry

Yesterday I got the public website deployments fixed and then moved on to figuring out how to do github actions. Didn't get as far as I would have liked. I think I was to distracted. 
After work there was no exercise and hand ball was cancelled due to weather. So I continued plucking away at my optical backup project. By the end of the day I had 8 dvds burnt with all my pictures safely stored upon them. I'll attempt to do similar with Megan's photos next. I may also image each disc and make duplicates just to be on the safe side. If I want to really go hard core, then store those duplicates in a different location.
Went to rehearsal, finished the chapter of the dragon book I was on. My interest in said book has seriously waned so I think I'll set it aside for next quarter. 
Played Skyward sword last night. We are getting very close to completing the game. But I don't know if we'll be able to complete the game next week. It all depends on how much time we'll have. Because of the elder board meeting going long we didn't have as much time as I would have hoped last night.
### March 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Productive weekend
2. Informative friends
3. Fun new software (grocy)

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves order

Entry

Friday was decently good. I got all of the GHAs done for reporter to some extent. After work I did my exercise and attempted to freeze Megan's credit. Unsurpisingly this was an annoying process. I still hope to have it accomplished before the end of the year this coming friday.
Saturday was a slow start. I slept in till 8, then I did the floors before I made breakfast. That was a bit of a mistake. I really should have done part of the wood floors, enough to get the dinning room table back into the dinning room, then made breakfast, then continue on cleaning the floor while the muffins cooked. Oh well, live an learn. This meant I woke Megan at 10 and didn't really get started on my day until about 11. But, fortunately, I had at that point already done my weekly chore so I was already ahead of the game. Finished up the upstairs shower faucet at last. snaked drains. Lots of little things have been coming into place. Hurrah for season of nothing new. It has been a productive season of catching up. And yet there are still things that I missed.
I tried working on my personal website for a bit and was struggling to get it to form the way I wanted. Maybe I need to scratch it and start over from the beginning. But while I was working on that Megan was working on price comparisons of organic dairy. We discussed various aspects of it and that made me remember grocy, which I had just setup. I showed her said ERP and that nerd snipped us for the rest of the afternoon. We talked and fiddled as we tried to figure out how to work the contraption. We are hopeful that it will be a useful tool, but golly is it a complicated tool.
After supper I showed and then played some hollow knight. I have experienced a 180 on that game. I wasn't enjoying it all that well and then I realized something: I'm playing it for the wrong reason. This is true of my anime consumption, my book reading, and my game playing. I'm consuming these media as a form of collection building rather than to actually enjoy consuming them or learn from them in the case of the educational books. I wanted to have as many feathers in my hat as possible and this meant that if the game was frustrating or anything but a push over it would annoy me and I wouldn't want to play it. I think this is part of what torpedoed "Spirit Farer" for me. The game was meant to be laid back and I was approaching it wanting to play at 2x speed to get more in. More! MORE! And what I realized is I need to do less but enjoy it. I need to pick books that I want to read because of the content not because I want to collect it.  I need to relax and enjoy the game I am playing. Explore. And most importantly when I find a hard boss, beat the sucker and enjoy the feeling of conquering something difficult! And this change in my attitude towards these things was immediately palpable in my experience of Hallow Knight. I am suddenly enjoying the game more, even the various moments of "welp, this wasn't the way forward, but I got something useful out of it." are enjoyable now not pains in the neck. And as a result, I am enjoying the game! Amazing how attitude can change your experience.
Sunday came and I mostly researched grocy during rehearsal. I almost forgot to pick up Megan and Lucy. Woops! Between services I put an effort into being social rather than hiding in the sound booth. I think this is good, I'm enjoying interacting with Greg or Derek or one of the pastors. I will keep on attempting such efforts. 
After church Megan and I spent time hammering out details about our garden plans. We started building a spread sheet and I contacted Tiahrts about their tiller. Unfortunately I forgot to include the month we'd be gone so Tom assured me that tilling after April 20th would be fine. Darn. I sent an email correcting our absence and haven't heard back yet. 
I played a little more Hollow Knight, made pizza, we watched "Sleepless in seatle" which was entertaining but the more we thought about it the more we realized it was really a pretty pathetic story. The main romance didn't actually have any romance. The characters weren't really all that compelling. So, enjoyed it once, would not watch again.
Lucy was an utter monster at bed time. Screaming, yelling, throwing a fit. We worked for almost an hour to calm her down. But we would not let her run away and cry in a corner. It was not exactly the aphordisiac I had hoped for as we approached bed time. But eventually she started to calm down. Hopefully we can break her of these tantrums soon.
### March 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A year wrapping up.
2. Peace of mind that we've done what we can to prepare for untimely deaths.
3. Warm weather beginning to set in. Spring has sprung!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes playdates for Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked away at the github actions automations for the website and reporter and finally got both of those buttoned up. I tried to start on webadmin but got stymied by everyone being gone by that point in the day. (also during the day I got on the phone with Experian and got Megan's credit frozen. Score. Just TransUnion left.)
After work Lucy was asleep and I've promised her to wake her for my exercise, but it was a little early for that yet so I went out to the garage and cleaned it and to get one more item checked off my habitica list. It was relatively nice the the garage, spring is almost here. 
Came in and worked on my desk a little till supper time and then after as well. I then went down stairs and did my exercise. When I came back up I decided to work on the fire safe. I took inventory of it. I hope to print off whatever information I wanted to add this evening to get that task checked off. Most comically though I found a pair of my mother's earrings, or so we suspect, in the little pouch for the safe deposit box key. 
Lucy wasn't a monster last night, which was a nice improvement.
### March 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. The year coming together, everything buttoning up.
2. The foresight to spend an entire season just catching up.
3. New guidance on what is worth my time, or rather making things worth my time.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is excited to do gardening this year.

Entry

Yesterday was pretty good. I got all of webadmin ready to go but because it is a higher profile service we are waiting till this morning to roll it out. I spent some of my spare time researching hashicorp vault and how I might use it personally in my docker-compose setup.
After work I tried to wake Lucy but had no luck. She out rightly told me to leave her nap so I went and did my exercise. After the exercise I gave it another try. This time I got her to come down with me. We had supper and then did papa time, played with dominos again. I'm relatively fine with her letting me do all the work but it gets a little thin when she then starts throwing dominos and jumping over domino tracks causing them to fall. After papa time I called trans union while I was finishing the compiling of retirement information. Transunion escelated me but appearently they escalated me to a department that was not open at those hours so the call terminated. *eye roll* But I did finish the retirement info, printed it, put it in the fire safe. Check and Check. All that is left on my habitica list is "freeze credit" and "clean desk." I am so close!
Lucy was annoying last night. I took her to her bed 4 times. It would have been 5 I'm sure if Megan didn't plop her on the edge of the bed instead of the middle the last time. 
### March 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Successfully finishing me prepparidness tasks. (Credit frozen, success!)
2. Delight returning to my games.
3. Excitement for a new year.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Shares her discoveries.

Entry

Yesterday I plucked at various things, wasn't terribly interesting.
After work I did my exercise. Then I made extensions for our hanging flower pots and hung them down in front of the window a little lower. I also transplanted the basil and hung the second pot up at last. We had supper. After supper I played with Lucy and her marble duplos for a little while. Then I started working on cleaning my desk. It's not as clean as I would really like it but there is a fair bit of things going on so I did what I could for now. I'll hopefully clean it up more as I clear various things off of it. 
Ben was late so I pulled up my Valheim world to see where I had left myself. It wasn't pretty. Not enough graydwarf eyes for a portal. Missing various other things. But I was excited to start fiddling again. Playing the game for pleasure. And I enjoy building and collecting so I started working on that. I'm probably going to cheat when it comes time to beat yagluth and give my personal world self my cooporative world armor. Or have Ben aid with his co-op world armor. But I don't really care about the boss fights so I'm fine with that. We'll see.
### March 24

Things I'm thankful for


1. Planning weekend coming.
2. Lucy having her first overnight with out us.
3. A relaxing evening.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is detailed.

Entry

Yesterday at work it happened that I spent most of the day in meetings. It was not a lot of fun but was mostly productive. Hopefully those meetings will bear fruit next week in real work getting done.
After work then I was brain tired and I took a nap. I then continued ripping music off of CDs to put into our digital collection. I was unable to rip video though so I need to find a better way to do that in the future. I've heard there are tricks. 
After supper I cleaned up a bit but I should have done more as I didn't realize how much Megan still needed to do before we could play games, that was on me. We finally got around to playing games around 8:00. We only managed to clear 1 of the 3 remaining stages as Megan wanted to do more side quests and in the spirit of relaxed game play I've taken recently, I did not argue. I felt kind of bad for looking up hints to these things though. It certainly dampened some of the pleasure of discovery as a result. 
### March 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Planning weekend
2. Lucy's First overnight
3. Tulips coming up!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes beautiful bullet journal pages.

Entry

Friday I got bogged down longer than I hoped in pipeline details. Hopefully I'll get back to my cycle work this this week.
After work my mom had arrived and it was time to head out to planning weekend. We gave Lucy lots of hugs and kisses good by and drove off with out her. From what my mom said though everything went quite alright. Lucy slept the whole night in her bed and didn't wake to go to my mom's. Perfection! She was very happy basically the whole time we were gone, and she had been very excited to have a night without mama or papa, and it was nice having a night without her. 
At the cottage we enjoyed having uninterupted reflextion time. Megan commented that even if we do include older children in the planning weekend some day we will probably continue to have time to reflex quietly just us at the start of it so we can have time to get thoughts out and time to talk potentially about the children and anything sensative about them. 
We had some good conversation and it was nice to seem some changes come about. The most interesting change right now is that we are dropping pizza movie nights. A stapple of our lives for probably 5+ years. But Megan's getting bored with Pizza, we are having trouble finding movies we like, and more importantly, movies that Lucy also wants to watch. So we are going to switch to "BBQ and Bonfire." Where we will be grilling and having a bonfire outside. It will encourage us to be outside more and just shakes up the routine. Depending on how things go we may invite friends in a standing invitation sort of way. "We are going to do this, if anyone wants to join for an hour or 3, come and go as you please." We also have a crap ton of fire wood I would like to burn through. 
I made plans for my bullet journal pages but I haven't done any work on them yet. Since I do most of mine digitally that wasn't really an option at the cottage and then I didn't feel like fighting the sun when we got home. I did other things like clearing the papers off my desk and we went for a walk to the library. around 4:30 I chatted with Brady for an hour and a half. It was a good chat. We had supper and watched Cars. It was enjoyable.
### March 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A restful week.
2. Secure personal networking.
3. My Bullet journal coming together.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a sexy woman.

Entry

Worked yesterday mostly on fixing the build pipeline for the public website. A few snafoos but over all things came together nicely.
After work I played with Lucy for nearly an hour until I said it was time to clean up then she was all to willing to play on her own. We had supper and I worked on my bullet journal. I got all the annual pages done and a bunch of the seasonal ones done. Then my virtual machine choked out and for some reason would not open natulis so I couldn't browse any files. Troublesome. I called it an evening and played some Hallow Knight until bed time.
### March 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good sleep
2. A warm day
3. Interesting problems at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys intimacy.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on scaffolder updates. Got past a problem with billing not wanting to build on my local machine. I also ran head long into time zone issues again. woohoo. :yuck: and then I worked on the new stuff that is a coming for device, exciting!
After work I discovered we had a collection of tulips in the porch that were supposed to go to faythe but she never came to pick them up, so I planted them. Hopefully they won't mind being planted in the spring, I know that will be a bit rough for them, I should probably water them. 
Then I cuddled with a Lulu who was having trouble waking up from her nap. We had supper, did a shortish papa time since we basically had papa time the night before as well. Then I worked more on my bullet journal. I think I've got all the pages designed, and boy could I feel how using yaml would probably simplify this process in the future. Now I just need to work on the compiling phase of this project, I'll do that tonight when I have the opportunity, it's going to be a whirl wind of a night as cubbies nights usually are.
I played Hollow Knight for about half an hour and beat the boss I was stuck on the previous night. Turns out that boss gave me double jump, thank goodness! Such a nice mobility ability to have. 
### March 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy growing up
2. Not having lost any data yet.
3. Some time with Megan

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys some quiet time at home.

Entry

Yesterday I got hammed by a DST issue in my code. I'm going to solve that problem to day or die trying.
Additionally I had file transfers going most of the day. Trying to get everything cleared off of my truenas instance so I could decomission it and just run everything off of the docker host. 
After work I woke the Lulu and we had supper. It was cubbies night, Megan and I both went to drop off Lucy then we did a little shopping and came home and relaxed with the Hard Cider we just purchased and a scotcharoo. It was nice having a little time to our selves. Then I went and picked up Lucy, she and Megan had a shower promptly upon my return and then I played games with Ben. It was a rough night. My phone kept dropping the call and the game crashed twice. 
### March 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Enjoying video games
2. Server file transfers nearing completion.
3. A nice relaxing week.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys video games like I do.

Entry

Yesterday I made good progress on the discussions around the device table, as well as a couple of other little things.
After work I continued file transfers from tellurium back to udgard. Poor tellurium's virtual disk of 500gb has 27gb left. Hope to be able to clear that off tonight. 
We had supper and I tried to work on my bullet Journal but Lucy didn't take a nap and was a royal handful keep to keep from turning into a crying mess. We got to video games as quickly as we could. But before we started we watched a preview for tears of the kingdom and preordered it last night. We are sooooo excited for this game, it looks amazing. 
We started on the final dungeon of Skyward Sword after completing a few more earends. Maybe next week we'll finish the game. But I have been enjoying it a lot more since I calmed down on the "MUST BEAT LOTS OF GAMES!" mind set.
