Development:
I want to skip using PDFNup. It's not working for me anyway. So what I need to do is read in a pdf into pypdf3, rotate it 90 degress, halve it in size, and lastly place it on a new page. So lets take those steps one at a time.

1. Read in pdf from - check
2. Shrink the pdf to half the size
3. Rotate the pdf to it on half the page
4. Place two items on one page.
