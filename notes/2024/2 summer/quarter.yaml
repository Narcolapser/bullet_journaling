theme: Season of Many Things
start: 2024-06-02
end: 2024-08-31
why: When I setup my annual goals there were a number of activities that I wanted to do that are not likely to fit into a the other themes of this year. Additionally I do not have a strong feeling at the start of this quarter what my theme should be. So this quarter my theme will be unfocused. I will do many un-related things that won't fit in during other times of the year so that when I get to those quaters I can be more focused during that quarter.
