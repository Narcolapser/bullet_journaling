theme: Season of Professional Foundations.
start: 2024-09-08
end: 2024-12-31
why: Last quarter I was promoted to Dev 3. Aspirations of Dev 4 will be some time coming. This quarter I want to start laying foundations upon which to build. Particularly the focus will be on establishing systems to track progress and provide objective measure of my development. What these systems even look like is a thing I will need to figure out. They will grow and change over the years but this quarter I will make a start.
