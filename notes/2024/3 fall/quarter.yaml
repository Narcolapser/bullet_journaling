theme: Season of Professional Foundations.
start: 2024-09-01
end: 2024-12-31
why: Having successfully been promoted to Dev Level 3 my attention now starts to pivot towards aspirations of Dev Level 4. I do not expect, of course, to be promoted any time soon. But I want to start laying foundations that I can build on over the next few years as I work towards the objective of being promoted. One of the significant foundations I want to establish grafana dashboards to track my development. These will change over the years, but should provide a good start.
goals:
- Find/Make a time tracking software and start making use of it.
- Setup a system for keeping records of the various things I want to track.
