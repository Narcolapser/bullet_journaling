This quarter is 5/8ths paternity leave, and 1 week gone to MI. While a significant part of this will be resting and recovery from the pregnancy, I also have a lot of time. An amount of time I am having a hard time grasping. Partly because it's so large, partly because it is unusual since I don't have a normal work day, but also because I don't really know how much time to set aside for child and spousal care. 

Priorities:
1. The main floor bathroom remodel
2. The craft room closet
3. Garden preparations
4. Clean and organize the garage
5. Build the black berry pergula.
