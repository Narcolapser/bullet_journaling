### April 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A beautiful new journal
2. Warm weather here at last!
3. A nice week to relax a bit.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages my crazy ideas some times.

Entry

Friday was a bit of conversation as we closed in on the final plans for the improved client telemetry and metrics. After work I finished up my bullet journal pages and got them printed. I started to work on printing my journal pages, like this one, printed, but I realized 9 months of those were on old alfheim so I need to pull them off a currently offline hard drive. Suck. I ended up waiting until the next day to work on that aspect of it.
Saturday morning we drove slowly to centervile since things were icy and snowy. But we made it. Had breakfast and picked up our meat box. Exciting! Organic grass feed meats! 
After we got home I pulled the data I needed off of old alfheim's hard drive and got my journal pages crafted. Took a little while as I wanted to keep the pages to a minimum since every 8 pages was another folio I had to bind. Then we went outside and enjoyed the weather a bit until evening came. I showed and enjoyed some video games.
Sunday was enjoyable. We had breakfast at Mr. Smiths and went to church. Miracilously despite having chocolate milk and a hearty breakfast I managed to stay awake through the whole service. Between the service and picking up Lucy and Megan I bound my new journal and selected which pens I wanted to use as I am switching to fine tipped colored pens this year instead of pencils. Hopefully that will result in my a even more beautiful bullet journal. 
After church I had a quick lunch and took a nap and headed out to the first ultimate frisbee of the year. woohoo! It actually wasn't all that fun with just 4 people and a lot of wind. But it was nice to be back out side. After that I relaxed with some hollow knight until it was time for evening prep. After the normal work, snas pizza, I went out to start the grill as it was our inaugural bbq and bonfire. But our propane tank was empty so I had go do a quick exchange. Appearently I had failed the proper winterizing of the grill last fall. Anyway. It worked out rather well. We used my camping work desk as a coffee table and sat around the bonfire, which struggled due to the wetness of the wood, but was never the less enjoyable.
### April 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good job
2. A quiet start to the quarter
3. A happy family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Detailed.

Entry

Yesterday I worked mostly on telemetery. There was a surprise in that the code I had made did not work in production while it worked fine in staging. Different versions of sql turned out to be the problem.
After work we took a walk. I got some soil samples from our yard to mail in. Had supper. I did some work on my journal and enjoyed some private time with Megan. Did a little bit fo fiddling on server stuff after that but over all it was a quiet evening. 
### April 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A happy marriage
2. New windows coming for our house next month!
3. Things starting to come together for my metric improvement plans

Thing I love about Megan: 
Talks to me.

Entry

Two days ago worked on deployments and metrics at work. After work I decided to try to run. It was my first run of the year, it was attempting to drizzel, and it was 36 degrees out. The temperature ended up not mattering that much so I think I can definitely do 35 or even 30 as my cut off in the future. But I was pretty exhausted as it was my first run of the year as stated previously. So I didn't make the full 3.1m but I did get to 2.7m. Man, Perhaps I should have just perservered through that last bit. After exercise I had lulu time before supper. We played dominos again, making contraptions. Then supper, then I worked on the budget.
Yesterday Megan took Mezo to the vet. She had to depart at 7:45 to do this which meant our morning was abnormal, which lead to me forgetting to journal yesterday. Work was a pretty successful day. The efforts of many previous days bore fruit. Data about devices in our database, reporter deploying to production, the new "design-system" service deploying. It was a good day.
After work I did my arm exercise, which was a bit of a trial. Lucy decided she not only wanted to help me by putting weights on the bars for me, but she was also providing new exercises for me to do. I had to remind her she was helping papa, not the other way around. 
After exercise we had supper and finished the budget. I wanted to work on setting up my habitica scripts to run automatically but Lucy was melting down having gotten up early and not having taken a nap. I manually ran my monthly habitca tasks and Lucy was all to happy to help me water the basement drain and the harp. And then we sent her through the shower so she could sit and watch shows and finally calm down.
Ben and I played Valheim last night, probably for the last time for a while. We finished the mistlands, beating the queen. So next week we are going to switch to starcraft II again and see if we can't finish leveling up our commanders.
### April 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A three day weekend
2. Lovely warm weather
3. A hope and a future

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans lots of activities for Lucy.

Entry

Thursday I dealt with more timezone issues. I hate it. After work I forgot to exercise. I forget now why we were busy but something distracted me. We got to video games early that evening since we wanted to finish Skyward Sword, we are so close. But we didn't achieve it this week either. But we did clear all the dungeon up to the final boss. So we just have final boss left to deal with. Very very close! Next week we should finish.
Friday was good friday and I had the day off. We went up to Sioux Falls for a little bit of shoping. Most importantly was Aldi but we also stopped by Scheels and got me new boots as my tore this last winter. Then we went to Palisaides state park. It was a nice park and a good candidate for work camping. Lucy was mostly a good listener but it was a very precipitous park with rocks by the river. Megan and I were wore tired just trying to corrale Lucy away from edges. And she was actively fighting us at times. It wasn't all in our head either as she tripped/slipped 3 times at points away from the edge. So we had some reason for our concern. 
That evening we went to the good friday service. When we got home I was so worn that I just sat and played video games for the rest of the evening, 1.5h, consuming my remaining habitica coinage. 
Saturday was busy. I spent far more of the day than I wanted driving around getting things so I don't feel like I accomplished much. But I did get the house re-grounded. Connecting a ground wire from one side of the water line around to the other after our new water meter created an electrical gap between the two pipes. Low effort, but important results. The highlight of the day was the DnD movie. It was my first successful "guys night" sort of activity. I don't think I'll try for more of such but it was an enjoyable event never the less. The movie was quite good. Was a pretty relaxed evening after that, didn't really do anything of note.
Sunday was fun. We went to the sunrise service and had breakfast at church. I went home and did a few things at home before returning for the second service. The kids skit was durring the second service and next year I am sitting in the front row. I have never fealt what I fealt during that skit watching Lucy be part of it. I realized I don't care if another human saw Lucy. But the smile on Lucy's face was wonderful. I want to be in the front row so she can see me seeing her. I loved seeing her up on stage, so confident, so calm. 
After church we came home and started working on Lunch. Amanda came over and we had easter dinner at 2:40. Lucy and I both took naps and then around 4:30ish we woke Lucy for an easter egg hunt. I did a "pinecone hunt" at the same time gathering all the pine cones from our yard. After that we just kinda lounged. I grabbed my work laptop so I could keep plucking away at getting my habitica tasks scheduled like they were previously. By the end of the evening I had gotten it working. 
During the day I had been playing some Valheim getting things setup so that Ben could help me on Wednesday. I'm kinda stuck on Yagluth and the boss fights aren't my favorite part of the game so getting Ben's assistance would be desirable. 
We had our bonfire earlier in the evening as Amanda is still on the over night shift and wanted to join us for at least some of it. We ended up going in around 7:30 or 8ish. In addition to getting my habitica tasks scheduled I also started figuring out how to get gitea up and running. Making progress on getting my whole infrastructure setup.
### April 11th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lovely weather
2. Time to think
3. Hope for more children

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants children

Entry

Yesterday at work I did a lot of thinking again. I have officially provided my recommendation that we back away from Otel. I don't think it has improved our lives in anyway. We'll see what people think tomorrow in standup.
After work we went and play our first round of disc for the year. Megan and I were both pleased and surprised with how well we did. I got two birdies. We then went home, grilled up some supper. We showered and latter than we had hoped we departed for my Mom's. We chatted until bed time. Today I'm working from her basement and at 11:45 we have a Doctor's appointment where we hope to hear about our future odds of having children.
### April 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Answers to questions about misscariages. 
2. The ability to work where ever I need to.
3. Progress at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Will hopefully be pregnant in the next few months

Entry

Yesterday was spent at my Mom's place. I worked from there. It wasn't the greatest. But it worked and allowed for an easy trip to the Doctor's office. We ended up sitting in the Doctor's office for almost an hour waiting for the Doctor to be available. But the good news was that we have a fixable problem. Some progesterone pills should allow Megan to hold on to a pregnancy better and get us through. I'm still holding out hopes it will also make her morning sickness less severe. 
After work we just hung around my mom's place. Drove home and went to bed.
### April 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Open windows
2. Plans of mine turning out successfully
3. Plants a growin!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is irresistable.

Entry

Yesterday at work got off to a slow start. But we finally got the timezone issue handled with the device tables, but we had to wait for the 9 hours of bad timestamps to become out dated. Annoying but managable. I would do other things. and oh how I did! I discovered first and foremost that the selectors at the top of the dashboards are what determine how fast the dashboard itself loads. Those taking 8-12s slowed everything way down so I repalced those and the dashboard loads now almost instantly. Success! I started working on some of the panels too. For the two I fiddled with they now go from dashboard loading to loaded in 2 seconds. What an improvement! I am SOOOOO glad that my plan worked out so well. I was getting a little nervous that my idea wouldn't actually pan out as well as hoped. 
After work it was cubbies night. So I skipped my normally scheduled exercise and grilled up some supper. I took Lucy to cubbies and came home. Megan and I had some time together and we made the most of it. Then we went to Dairy Queen, got some shakes, and went for a little walk in the neighborhood around church while we waited for cubbies to conclude.
Came home and I played some Valheim with Ben. He helped me get unstuck in my personal world by helping me kill Yagluth. We then played some starcraft 2, finally beating the one coop mission we were stuck on. 
I noted earlier in the evening the growth rate of the seeds I had planted. It hadn't even been a week and 8 out of the 12 trays had sprouts in them! Holy molly temperature makes a huge difference!
I've been meaning to write this down for a while. I forgot to mention in a previous entry that I had a chat with Kees-jan. April 4th. He and his wife are going through some hard times right now as she is attempting to get a divorce. And it is another moment of putting my life in perspective. I compare myself sometimes to people like Kees-Jan or Justin, my coworker 5 years my Junior, and how successfully they are, wishing and striving to be as good of programmers. However I do have to take a step back and consider, yes, Justin may be a Dev Level 4, but by the time I was his age I had been married Almost 2 years, he is still single, not even dating that I am aware of. I've got another 33 years of employment ahead of me at least. So I'll take the setback in my professional life to have the personal life happen sooner. Heck, if going back to working at used could bring my 6 children who didn't even get to be born back to me, i.e. I'd have 7 children now instead of 1, I would do it in a heart beat. And a similar story to Kees-Jan. I hope I never hurt my marriage enough to the point where Megan feels like divorce is the only option. And of course there is Jason Ekstrand, who now goes by Faith because he's decided to transition into being a woman. While I envy his position as a person of influence with SIGRAPH and his tallent, I'm glad to have my sanity. I dream of becoming the kind of person who gives talks at conferences and writes books that people read for inspiration. But I am not interested in sacrificing my family or my sanity to get there. 
### April 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Excitement for Tears of the kingdom's release
2. Nice snappy dashboards
3. All my sprouts sprouting!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Handles Lucy in the bed far better than myself. 

Entry

Yesterday I worked on frontline's dashboard really leveraging the new device table. It's specatular what has resulted. The dashboard loads so fast. You can reload it 5 times in the time it takes for the old one to load. I am pleased. But now I need to figure out what to do about the rest of the panels that need extra care. 
After work I did my first round of core exercises. I can feel it today so that's a good sign. After exercise we had supper, then it was a chat with Megan's family about the up coming vacation and all the planning around it. as that was wrapping I did the dishes so that we could jump straight away into video games as we were beginning to run out of time. We finally got to games a little after 8 and went straight into battle with "Demise" I got through the first phase, but couldn't quite pull off the second phase. And surely there are going to be at least 3 if not 4 or 6 so we backed off and went in search of some re-enforcements. Better shields, better potions, etc. That consumed the rest of the evening. It's kind fun being in the "Gather the resources" phase of these games some times. It's when we fill out all the little side quests. 
### April 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A finished index
2. Rapidly growing sprouts
3. A new sink faucet

Thing I love about Megan: 
Trusts me to make changes to the house.

Entry

Friday I spent the day learning about our cronjob pattern and implementing a metric snapshooter for our device activity. After work I ran, got a full 5k this time. 
I worked on getting drone up and running after work. I've got pipelines running but not yet accomplishing my objective. I want get the full dev-ops pipeline working such that when I push changes to a container's repo it redeploys that service. Yet to be successful on that one. I think I need to play around with pipelines a little more. 
Saturday came. I made Carrot Coffee Cake for breakfast. It was quite good. We finished episode 2 of JP's Genesis lecture series. After that I got started on replacing the upstairs sink faucet. Plumbing is gross. But I extracted the old faucet and got the new one installed with some effort. I don't know how I was supposed to remove the old drain so I ended up just cutting it off. That resulted is some further annoying effort to finish the extraction. By the time it was Lunch time I was done with most of it except the cold water which had a gentle leak. The valve itself seemed bad so I ran to the hardware store to buy a new valve. I found that fast enough but then I wanted to get some fertalizer for our yard soon to be garden. But I wasn't finding exactly what I wanted so I spent a while running around looking at various things in Ace, then Runnings, then tractor supply, no dice. I may try the nursery or amazon at this point. But this meant I was out for a while on a wild goose chase. 
When I finally got home I installed the new valve and there was still a leak. Dishartened I had lunch and took a nap and searched for advice online. The advice that ended up working was "put more Teflon tape on it" so I wrapped 4 times around the threads and sure enough that worked. I think the socket I pulled it out of was slightly damaged. Anyway. It worked, it was 3 o clock at that point so I called it a day on plumbing projects. I had hoped to get to the main floor sink's hot watter but it just wasn't in the cards for the weekend. I didn't want to turn off all the water to the house that late in the day. After that I sat down at my computer and hacked away at my habitica scripts. I got them to the point where weekly tasks left un-done cause damage! We'll see what I think of this new mechanic. 
Sunday was pretty nice. We got to sleepy in till 8 and made our way to church. I stayed awake through the whole service. After the service I volunteered to hand out shirts at the front desk for City Sweep. Stayed there till the second service started. Once home I worked on my full journal for 2022. I bound 6 folios onto the journal. Returned to church to pick up Lucy and Megan. Came home. had lunch. took a nice relaxing nap. Just chilled on the sofa with Megan and Lucy for a little. Then I returned upstairs to continue work on the full journal index. 10 folios remained and I bound them all. My index is now complete. Now I need to start figuring out how to do the next phase: The cover. Though I also noticed some errors in the printing of the journal pages as I was finishing up. I'll have to do better next year.
After that I came down and played hollow knight. I'm getting a little bored of the game but I still am surprised at how different I play the game now that I have taken a different attitude towards it. I'm certainly getting much more enjoyment out of the game when I play it just for enjoyment. I managed to get my nail upgraded twice by the end of the evening. When I get back to the game I should be in a good condition to continue the effort to complete the main story. 
When I called it quits for the evening I saw the kitchen and decided "I'm going to clean it all." And take a load off of Megan. I filled the drying rack 3 times. It was a lot of dishes but I got probably 95% of them done before I felt like I really needed to shift gears and tackle making supper. We didn't end up having a bonfire because it was just to windy. Sad. But we did sit inside and watch 4 new episodes of bluey. That was very enjoyable.
### April 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lovely evening to play disc
2. Some time to myself
3. A healthy sense of fear.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is stretching her self and being social.

Entry

Yesterday I nearly pulled my hair out working on getting data to come out of data integrator. I don't know why it wasn't working but then suddenly it was. Frustrating.
After work we went and did frisbee golf, then Megan headed out for a Sunday school teacher meeting and dinner at the Hansons. Having spent lunch and the hours surrounding it with Tiahrts it ended up being a very social day for her. I spent the evening quietly at home. I made myself some biscuits and gravey like I usually do when I am home alone and then went out to the back yard to do some planning of how we were going to actually layout the yard. I placed rocks to act as guides for the throught process. I climbed up on the roof to get a picture and spooked myself. The realization that I could fall and die and no one was around to rush me to the hospital. I think this is a good level of fear honestly.
After I finished up outside I plucked away at build pipelines on gitea and drone. I've got somethings rolling now but I still haven't quite gotten it to do proper deployments just yet. I'm inching closer though. 
### April 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Freinds who lend us things
2. Beautiful weather last night
3. Work beginning on our garden!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of Lucy and myself

Entry

I pounded on data integrator and got it working before the end of the day. Now I just need it merged.
Hadn't heard from Tom so I decided to do my evening run, that ended up being a mistake. I got home, started cleaning Urbosa while Megan was making supper and while we were doing that Tom showed up with the tiller. So after supper I spent the rest of the evening tilling our back yard. It was pretty tiring but I got it all done. I had a moment of "past the point of no return now." and then I realized "ya no. I can just sow grass seed and we can pretend this never happened." We were commited more so when we put our order of plants in. An order which hasn't come in yet, I wonder where that is... Not that I'll be planting before next Monday as we expect a hard frost saturday night and a light one Sunday. But still, I'd like to get those plants in soon so we can start covering our now exposed ground. 
After the tilling was completed I came in and Megan gave me a hair cut. Quite the busy evening. 
I finished reading "Measure what matters." and I give it 3 stars. I wasn't terrible impressed with the book over all. I feel like it could have been summarized "Have specific objective, then have measurable key results that when completed mean the objective is complete." and instead I got 8 hours of testimonials, that is to say somewhere between Ipse Dixit and an appeal to authority. But I'll make the best use of some of the thoughts I had from it. Like if my objective at work right now is to get promoted to Level 3, then what are the key results I need to work on? I feel like "Review 70% of Delta PRs, even if I'm not first to it." would be one. Perhaps something about answering team mate questions would be another good one. 
Last night was a bit rough. I was so exhausted from the days work. Then Lucy started in our bed. I took her out. She started sleep walking, I returned her to her bed. She came and slept in our bed during the worst of the thunderstorm. I returned her to her bed. She came back around 6:40. It was rough.
### April 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Private Space Flight
2. A happy little girl
3. Tasty food

Thing I love about Megan: 
Trusts me.

Entry

During work I mostly banged my head on metrics not showing up. I was very frustrated.
I went to the dentist to get a cavity filled. I don't understand it. All through my child hood I only ever just brushed my teeth with a manual tooth brush. But now as an adult I brush with an electric tooth brush, I floss, and I do mouth wash and now I'm getting cavities left and right. It is infuriating. 
After work Megan had left to go watch "Return of the King" for it's 20 year aniversery in a cinema. She and Amanda went. Leaving me home alone with Lucy all evening. We effectively had an extended Papa time. We made supper, we cleared her mud hole, we went for a walk with her riding in the wheel barrow, and went searching for korok seeds. Then I played some star craft with Ben until bed time. Bed time went fairly well. We watched some bluey while brushing our teeth and then she watched a few more while I did my journaling. We ended the evening by getting some books and reading them in bed. She of course complained she wasn't tired but went to bed fairly quickly non the less. It wasn't to bad.
This morning SpaceX launched Starship for the first time. It was a failure but they did demonstrate the booster and all the engines running. It was quite impressive. Hopefully the next launch they can get their stage seperation system fixed.
### April 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun games with family
2. Fun games with co-workers
3. Work coming together

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is sympathetic to my physical needs.

Entry

Yesterday I spent mostly in preparation. I've got to give a presentation to frontline on monday about their dashboard and doing metrics so I'm trying to put together the information in a cohesive way.
After work I did my core exercises. We had supper, went to rehearsal, came home and Megan and I discussed cakes for a little since my birthday is next week. After a while Lucy started to wake up and was her normal grumpy wakeup self. I sat and played BotW with her searching for korok seeds. She perked up after a bit and we switched over to Skyward Sword as Megan quickly finished the menu. I started playing in the battle areana. But we gave up thinking that I would have to beat all the bosses to get the Hylian Shield. Not so! I will only have to beat 8 so maybe I'll try again next week. But at this point we also need to think about calling it quits so we can switch to Tears of the Kingdom when we get back from vacation. 
### April 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. City Sweep going well
2. Plumping project going well
3. Hopes for a beautiful garden

Thing I love about Megan: 
Oh so cuddly

Entry

Friday I spent most of the day working on my presentation for frontline. I'll run through it again this morning. I want to make sure I hit everything and preferably with the right levels of emphasis. 
After work I ran despite the on and off snowing. Got home and worked on my dev-ops arrangements for my own stuff. I finally have it all working correctly and am able to make a change to the scripts repo and push it and have those changes reflected in my container running on my server.
Saturday I made pumpkin scones, they were a little under cooked. We were going to do our normal couple's bible study but then Brady called during that time frame so we skipped it. That's alright though since we are going to be out of the house during that time frame the next 4 weeks. 
After that I prepared for the plumbing adventure. I didn't end up executing until after lunch, but I finally did it. I drained the house, I removed the old valve, and installed a new one, replacing a little bit of the pipe that was damaged in the process. Success. It was a quite a pain as the valve was shut so I couldn't get the water to just flow out of the pipe. Had to do some finagleing but eventually got it empty enough that I could melt the solder. Once I had I noticed that the pipe where I had been blasting heat was half full of sediment, probably from all the water I had just evaporated. 
After that I went back to server stuff. I got the auto receipts contianer up and running on udgard. Or at least mostly running. There is certainly some questions about whether the scrappers work or not. We shall see. Finished it just before it was time for worship team pot luck.
The pot luck this spring was much more attended than in the fall. Megan and I sat and chatted with Lisa for a little, mostly Megan actually so I swivvled and chatted with the rest of the worship team. It's a little weird that I'm one of the old guys there. Deanne Ekstrand is one of the people in the group and I of course remember her as an infant and then child when I came to their house for homeschool stuff. We chatted about lots of things, Deanne and I bringing up homeschooling. 
After that we returned and played some Zelda. I got through the 8 fights I needed to in order to get the Hylian shield. Then we went to fun fun island until we got the heart piece. I tried to earn us some more ruppies but with out the motivation of the heart piece it was hard to keep the same level of focus. Didn't really get anywhere by the end of the evening. 
Sunday was a busy day. I left early for sound. Came back picked up Megan and Lucy. Between services I helped check a few things but it was mostly quiet. After second service things stepped up quickly. We were still delayed by Jimmy Johns but we got everyone out by 1 which was great. The group I lead did well, and over all it sounded like all the groups got through everything quite promtly. Hurray teams! The BBQ in the evening was enjoyable. Chatted with Derek about phones. 
After we got home we did a few chores preparing for the week since we didn't have our normal sunday rest and prep time. Once that was done I played some Hollow night. I beat the second of the 3 seals and so I am closing in on the conclusion of the game soon. Though it is unlikely I'll beat it before the end of this quarter with how much time we will be gone on vacation. We'll see. 
We went out to see the northern lights at 10 before we went to bed. They were just visible. Lucy fell asleep in the car. It sounds like they were much more spectacular around midnight. 
Lucy woke me at 6 with flailing in our bed. As usual I took her to her bed at this point and hoped for another 50 minutes of shut eye but then she started crying. I tried sleeping through it but she just persisted so 20 minutes later I gave up. I sent her down stairs and she started watching paw patrol which pissed me off again. I shut the TV off to kill Paw Patrol immediately and then turned it back on to put on Bluey while I got her dressed. I then went about my morning tired and cranky from missing an hour of sleep. `-_-`
### April 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A successful presentation to team frontline
2. A good night sleep
3. A cozy bed

Thing I love about Megan: 
A cozy wife

Entry

Yesterday was dominated by the preparation for my presentation for front line. It was a bit slow as I was sleepy from my rude awakening from Lucy. Over the lunch hour I also helped dump the debris from city sweep at the landfill. That took a little longer than hoped but we got it all done. After work we played disc. It took us a bit but I got a pretty good score of about 31 if I counted correctly. We ran into Aaron and Vicky while we were walking and chatted with them for a while. We got home and Megan started working on supper. I fiddled on my computer a bit till it was ready and then after supper Lucy and I went to the playground. We stayed there till Lucy was shivering because the silly girl didn't want to take a coat or wear close toed shoes. We got back home and I wrote a bit about a programming language idea I've had banging around in my head for a while before heading up to bed. 
### April 26

Things I'm thankful for


1. Things starting to come together for our garden
2. Nice weather after a cold weekend.
3. A completed cycle.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Supports me in the good things I do

Entry

Yesterday I mostly spent preparing the presentation for today. It went well, I kept the time working on it to a minimum. After that I worked on some cool down tasks.
After work I ran. Then while I waited for Megan to make supper I started entering receipts for April. Trying to make use of what little time we have between now and our departure. The Theatre Festival this weekend really hosed us for free time. So I've got to be somewhat strategic at this point. I sure wish those plants we ordered would arrive already!
After supper I went out to re-arrange our rock boarder since our new garden area has changed where it should go. Our front and back yards are now split apart entirely. I'll need to put some stepping stones down but that can wait till after the vacation. After I finished most of the work I sent a message to Greg Hanson asking if he was home yet since I wanted to by some strawbales off of him. He had forgotten to text me when he departed and said he was home now. I mounted up and headed out. I wanted 8 bales but could only fit 5 in the trunk of the van. So I settled for that. We'll see how much it covers. Then I relaxed for the remaining minutes. We also transferred our block of lard from the farm near by to a tub so it is now in a re-sealable container and we can make use of it.
### April 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 33 years of life
2. My wife
3. My daughter

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a lovely wife

Entry

Yesterday I worked on cool down tasks and in the afternoon I gave Emily a crash course on harness and the connection between github and harness. In the evening I skipped exercise as it was a cubbies night but also we are running low on time at this point so I'm dropping things that aren't necessary. I cleared all the recycling out of the porch so I could put the stuff from the garage into the porch to make room for our windows! Next monday our windows will be coming in and then while we are gone Greg believes they will be able to replace all the windows. woohoo! That will be exciting to return to. When I finished cleaning we had supper and then went to Cubbies Award night. Lucy didn't manage to do any of the songs up on stage but she did stand and didn't run away or something. That's good. After Cubbies I started cleaning the car in preparation for our departure. Then played some starcraft with Ben and called it a night.
### April 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lot of the plants in the ground
2. My lovely wife
3. A good life

Thing I love about Megan: 
Cares about me

Entry

Yesterday I just did odds and ends at work. The day did start with a group of marmots wishing me happy birthday. They tried to stay in sync and it resulted in just a really slow tempo making it sound like a birthday dirge. I was amused.
We had finally gotten our plants so after work I started working on some of that. Specifically I started placing rocks to try to figure out where things should go. It was hard to place things with out some sort of land mark to guide what was going to go where. Then I went to rehearsal. Came home and continued to garden, getting all the cherries and the tree planted and watered in. Huzzah! That's the biggest concern I had tackled. I would like to plant the pumpkins and the strawberries saturday or sunday so that everything that can go in the ground is in before we depart. I think I'll let the seedlings grow a little longer in their green house.
Lucy and Megan gave my a hand painted girffe last night for my birthday. Sure it's not anything significant but I'm to the point now where I think that's preferable. I'm starting to feel the "Less stuff" mind set. Obviously I still have tons of stuff but I said starting. I've got everything I need and then some so it is nice to have little things made by my little girl. 
### May 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. My theatre friends
2. A little Lucy that handles My and Megan's absence well now
3. Plants in the ground

Thing I love about Megan: 
Goes to the theatre with me.

Entry

Friday it just worked on odds and ends.
After work we headed out to Orange City for a theatre festival. The festival was enjoyable but I was sad how few people from my era were there. Myself, Ab, Tressea, Erica, Uncle Joe, and Sheric were it. I enjoyed getting to chat more with Sheric. I realized only as my time was drawing to a close at NWC that I should have spent more time with him. We got home friday night after when we expected Lucy to be asleep, but she was not quite so.
Saturday was pretty relaxed. We played in the morning. Wandered around campus a bit and then went home and had lunch. Just Megan and I returned to see "Harvey" at 2. We wandered a bit after the show as it wasn't quite banquet time. We went to the athletics center to see what the new part of it looked like since I hadn't seen it yet. No dance area. And Rush appearently is dying out. It sounds like Dance peaked in my era and has since mostly gone by the way side. That's sad. We got to the banquet and that's when I got to chat with Sheric more since he was seated at the table with us. He gave a presentation on what he is doing now as an Alum in the business currently. We then headed back to my Mom's and headed home.
Sunday we had church. After church we dropped Lucy off at Amanda's and walked to the Cinema to see "The Super Mario Brother's Movie" which was good. It was, in my opinion, a great example of a story very well crafted but lacking a certain spark to it that would have made it amazing. What Megan and I settled on was it checked all the boxes correctly, but perhaps didn't put enough emphasis on the right ones. Which was hard to be frank. The movie had a lot of ground to cover in a short 90 minutes. There was not a lot of time to spare for breathing. But the biggest problem was that it didn't seem to signal the transition from act one to act two very well. But all those details aside it was a very enjoyable movie.
In the afternoon I planted strawberries and pumpkins and covered a bunch of the garden with straw. I watered the plants but while I was doing such I also watered the straw to trie to help keep it down. I also put some rocks and such down to try to keep the edges of the straw down. It worked fairly well by the time I was done but I was fighting the wind the whole time. It was quite annoying.
After that I came in, did a few things before calling it a night. After I showered I sat down to play some hollow knight. Got frustrated at a mid boss fight and got bored. I left it and went to program a little before bed. I got a basic interface for uploading receipts up and running so we can send arbitrary receipts up in a hurry when we are out and about. I was pleased with how well some of the deployment pipeline stuff I had been working on had come together. Getting it up and deployed was quite easy.
### May 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. New windows coming in!
2. Lovely days
3. Quick and easy made software

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans very well

Entry

Yesterday I mostly worked on the script to migrate our passwords out of harness. Got hung up for a bit but got it working before the end of the day. After work I cleaned the car. Vacummed up the whole thing so it was nice and clean and ready for our trip. Then we had supper. After supper I quickly designed a "strap" for our bathroom ceiling. This was a little piece of plastic with a pair of screw holes designed to keep the ceiling tiles in our bathroom holding together longer than the tape is currently achieving. Perhaps this fall we can get around to re-modeling our mainfloor bathroom. Then we worked on preparing the guest room and craft room for the coming window replacement. All the windows arrived today and Greg said he's going to start on Friday. Exciting! we will leave and return with new windows!
### May 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. A coming vacation
3. Everything coming together for said vacation

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Yesterday I continued odds and ends. Just doing little chores in the lead up to my departure. During the day I was also printing struts on my printer to hold the bathroom ceiling together since the tape was no longer cutting it. I did that in the evening after other things had been tended to. The most important thing I did is down sample little worship company and load it and all of bluey onto Lucy's phone. I also loaded all of bluey onto Argon. 
I made a mistake last night. Lucy's phone doesn't have CE on it so I was tempted and gave in to looking at some porn, if only briefly, on said device. I am ashamed. Clearly I cannot be trusted with any un-supervised device. 
### May 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good vacation
2. Time with Family
3. A lovely home to return too.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans great trips. I usually can entirely just let her handle things.

Entry

What an adventure. 
Thursday morning we get loaded up and head out. Of course the day we are traveling with a whining cat is the day we both get stuck at the rail crossing and Lucy can't wait till Gigi's and needs to go potty now. So our 1h5m trip streched to 1h30m of cat meowing. But we got there, dropped the cat off, got going. We were a little later than planned getting to Megan's grandfolks place, but it wasn't to bad all things considered. 
The next morning we loaded up and started trucking again. This time with Josh entertaining Lucy. Made to our hotel, I was falling asleep in the passenger seat. I was getting sick of driving already. Third day of driving. Got there just before Dark. Got camp set up.
Our first day was a rest day. Met Sam, Nathan's Girlfriend, just got settled into our new abode, did some hiking at a near by trail. The other days got fuzzy as to what we did when. We went to a pequat museum and saw a lot of interesting stuff there. Learned a fair bit about the people group and how they lived. One piece that I came away with in particular was a comment that it wasn't that the native people didn't have a system of ownership and it wasn't that they didn't develop the land, it also wasn't that the colonists were brutal thieves, the problems of colonials stealing native land was simply rooted in culture shock. The natives developed land in easy ways that involved minimal change to the environment as they only had stone tools. The colonists seeing what to them was un-developed land assumed they weren't using it and took it for them selves. Presumably the natives were fine with the "taking" as they probably didn't understand what the settlers meant. It was all a miss understanding all around.
On our first day of driving Megan and I had some discussion about nudity and where we want our family to sit on the topic. We discussed the "san" people from "the god's must be crazy" whom mostly roamed around topless, some times completely naked during the heat of the day. Some consideration was had around that. It is interesting to point out that even though they had a much more lax attitude towards nudity and some aspects of sexuality, they did still have social norms and structures and some activities were considered taboo, they really aren't that different from us in some ways. But the most significant difference is a much more village mindset to raising children which Megan and I were certainly lamenting our culture's lack. Fortunately that is one aspect that we can change some parts of. We can have people, specifically friends with children, over more often to build up more of a village. 
Anyway, one of the reasons I mention that was the irony of discussing this and then going to the pequat museum, another people group who seemed to prefer to go topless most of the time and so the display village had women, from children to old women, all topless and made no bones about it. The did make a comment that it wasn't a lack of modesty, it was just culturally breasts weren't seen as sexual objects. 
We went to Nathan's graduation, what was a long dry service. But everyone was expecting that. We went to the beach in Rhode Island and had some fun on play grounds and rocks. I'm sure I've missed something but those were the major events I recall. 7 nights at that site.
We went our separate way from Megan's family at that point. We drove to upstate New York and they went home. We stayed 4 more nights at our next hip-camp camp site. We visited the letchworth state park and saw the water falls. Though we were getting pretty tired by this point in the trip and didn't hike as much as I would have expected. We spent a day at the museum of play in Rochester. We saw the large dam that protected it all. We then drove to Erie PA and went to a park and a maritine museum there. The park was the official end of the vacationing portion of our trip. Once we finished we packed up and headed to Ohio where we stayed with Roland and Luvina. They showed us around on their Gator and we hit the sack.
Next day we drove to Iowa. We got there actually fairly early at about 4. There are a couple of moments that I have noticed in differences between myself and Jeff. It started years ago, I think before Megan and I were even married. They were cleaning out a kayak that had mice living it it, and it hadn't been enough to get the mice out but they killed them all with a shovel. At the time I felt that was excessive but at least there was an argument of they were vermin and we don't want to encourage this behavior. At our campsite in CT there was at one point a caterpiler was dangling in the middle of our site on a bit of silk. Jeff and I moved towards it. I was going to pluck it and chuck it out of the site, it might have killed it but it may well survive. Jeff got there first, specifically plucked it and ground it under his foot. Was that really necessary? And then we we got to their place he was excitedly telling me about bella eating 5 baby rabits in their back yard, one of which he specifically crushed with a shovel. Again I get they are vermin, but was it really necessary? Bella gonna eat vermin, that doesn't bother me, the fact that he specifically killed one so that none would get away while he ran to get bella just seemed like over kill. 
By the end of that day I was getting pretty grumpy from all the traveling. The next day I was feeling much better, I think because I no longer had the remaining day of travel looming over me, the final day was here, we were going home. We made it to my Mom's fine and after an hour there we kept going and got home around 6:10. We got in and got our selves sorted. I mowed the lawn, and by the time I had showered it was 9:10. Never the less we trucked on and started Tears of the Kingdom. 
Sunday came. I woke up around 7 and decided to get up and continue efforts to put the house back together. I started with fixing a cert issue with Home Assistant, then I started putting screens in the windows. We went to church. Derek informed me that he was retiring from his position as the lead sound guy at the end of this schedule. He said he's just been doing it to long, 20 years is enough. I'm not sure what is going to be the plan next. Whether I'll be asked to step up into his position or if Noah is just going to run rough shod over everything. *shrug* I'm not to concerned either way.
Between services I came home and worked on a few things. Trying to eliminate as much as possible what stood between us and playing video games after church. I picked up Megan and Lucy. We got home. I went and played ultimate in the park. It was a good game since we had 10 people. It was almost to many. I got home and Megan left so I fiddled with some things on my computer while I waited for her to return. Finally we got back to Zelda. Played till about 5:30, took a break for supper, did some weeding, got back to Zelda. We played until about 9 at which point we took a walk to conclude our evening. 
It has been a good 2 and a half weeks. And I think I made the most of it all.
### May 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A lovely garden
2. A fun new Zelda game
3. A good start to my return to work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes great care of Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday was the first day back at work. It was a little weird not having standup in the morning. It wasn't until after lunch that I actually interacted with some one. I managed to get caught up on all the reading I cared to do by lunch time. I decided to skip most of the update channel. I handled some of the annual review stuff and then started working on trying to get data out of our new influx servers.
After work we opted to not go do family exercise by playing disc and instead we did some gardening. It was good. Hopefully here soon we can plant some more plants and get the rest of the garden growing. We also need to pick out what we are going to use as mulch so we can start covering our paths to prevent weeds. This effort went on into the evening and I decided to shower afterwards, as did Megan. By the time we had accomplished all that and put our clothes away, it was bed time. We tried watching Star Trek:TOS, but we were getting so board we were falling asleep. So we didn't finish the episode. Maybe we will finish the series that way, it makes a great bed time show when it's so dull you fall asleep.
### May 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. More things going in in our garden
2. A cozy bed even if Lucy keeps us awake
3. A decision about metrics

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages our garden craziness

Entry

Yesterday was the reckoning for metrics. The decision was made to back off of OTEL for now and proceed with telegraf and try to polish it up. That will be the remainder of my pitch now.
After work I ran. I was so hot afterwards I lounged in the basement trying to cool off. Since I started work early I finished at 4 and did the dishes just before supper. After supper we went to running and bought some plants. Mostly flowers as the herbs were covered by my seedlings. We had hoped to find mulch that we liked but had no such luck. None of it felt terribly great under foot. We are going to try to buy mulch from the city now instead. The recycled mulch from cutting down trees seems to be nicer. I worked as hard and fast as I could but didn't get everything. I've got a few more plants that could be planted, We'll see about those. We finished the evening off with just a little Tears of the Kingdom. Didn't accomplish anything terribly notable. 
Lucy fell asleep while we were driving to runnings, around 6:40. Going to bed 4 hours early resulted in her waking up a lot in the middle of the night. Hopefully she'll nap today and get back on a sane schedule.
### May 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Our garden continuing to come together
2. Clarity on metrics at last.
3. Door sensors I bought a few months back now working.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very cuddly in the morning

Entry

Yesterday I spent the morning thinking through and crystalizing my plans for metrics. I hope to actually get coding on it today but Todd has rightly asked me to inquire of other teams before we move forward on this. 
After work I did dishes and did some gardening. Things are getting more filled out every day, I'm excited. We'll see how much of it ends up surviving as the year presses on. 
As I was getting towards the end of my work for the evening Megan walked out with a kiddy pool and shortly there after Lucy. Lucy had refused to take a shower but had agreed to bathing in a kiddy pool. So as I was stuffing bags to hang with strawberry plants Lucy sat naked in the kiddy pool in the back yard. It was rather amusing and she got rather cold, though it was like 80 degrees out so it wasn't to bad. The water was cold but the air was warm. And to her credit she did let Megan wash her hair. It ended up working well. We concluded the evening with more Tears of the Kingdom. Finally got our glider.
### May 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good exercise
2. A lovely garden all coming together. 
3. A phone video game to play

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes Zelda games

Entry

Yesterday I mostly plucked away at my new metrics file and documentation for it, at work. After work I did the dishes, did some trimming and weeding and a little more planting. Then I went and played Ultimate Frisbee in the field by the highschool. It was quite enjoyable. I felt wiped after the first 15 minutes but gradually settled into an equilibrium. Hilariously we heard thunder and Sabrina said she saw lightening in the distance. But the rain never came so we kept on playing. Continued playing Tears of the Kingdom after I got home. Not much to report yet, We activated a tower and got to Kakariko village. 
### May 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My mother and her long life
2. A weekend to get together with siblings
3. Hopes for another child soon

Thing I love about Megan: 
Says crazy things some times like "lets just play video games the rest of the day." xD

Entry

Friday I worked on cleaning up my metrics file getting it ready to share. After work I tried to do some reading mostly so that I can finish my "Dreaming in Code" book by tomorrow.
Saturday comes and I do a couple random things like watering plants. Nothing big. We mostly are getting ready to depart to my Mom's place. I had hoped for a chance at intimacy but Megan's Family showed up as we were approaching the point where that might have been an option so we didn't before we departed. Glad they showed up when they did and not 10 minutes later, that would have been SUPER annoying. 
The weekend at my mom's went great. We mostly sat around and chatted. She opened presents and Lucy and Sam had a good time together. I had some interesting interactions with Sam. I felt he was picking me out of the crowd and Brady confirmed that was likely the case. I apparently mean a lot to him since I will rough and tumble with him. But golly can he push buttons. I think he was specifically pushing buttons as he is still working through a lot emotionally. It is clearly going to take several years before he is solid in his self worth.
After we returned home we had supper and spent the rest of the evening playing Tears of the Kingdom. It was a nice restful way to end our weekend. An interesting note I realized as Megan was lamenting about how the last game we played was played on my paternity leave and so we could just sit for hours in a day and play the game. Now we are having to slip it in during our normal schedule. But on top of that the different feeling for me in particular is the fact that when we played breath of the wild I played it nearly exclusively until after the game was beaten and then Megan ran around picking up Korok seeds and the like (eventually getting to the point where she was beating up lionels for their parts). Now we are trading off which means half the time I'm not playing. Additionally Megan does play a little slower than I do so it compounds on that. But over all I'm happy to share.
### May 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Megan's chance glances.
2. The light at the end of the metrics tunnel.
3. Things growing

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

More refining on the metrics file yesterday. I attempted to use influx db client to handle everything but it doesn't like our writing to telegraf so at the end of the day I decided against that approach.
After work I read some until it was supper time. Then after supper Lucy and I went to the pool for the first time this year. It went well I would say. Lucy was well behaved about walking there and back and left when I told her it was time to go. After we got back I water plants, then read some more. We wanted a little time to play TotK (Tears of the Kingdom), so I paused with a scant hour left to read in my book. So close. Will finish it today hopefully.
### June 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Cool nights
2. Exercise
3. Fun games

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is adventurous

Entry

I apparently forgot to journal yesterday. The last two days of work have been mostly the same, working on metrics, getting the new metrics file pushed out to everywhere. 
After work on Wednesday, I started preparing the lawn for mowing and played with Lucy at the same time. We grilled some fish and then I mowed the lawn. Listening through 7-eves right now and there are just certain parts of this book, which I'm sure Neal Stephenson included to humanize it and make it sell better, that bore me to tears. I don't care who is sleeping with who, who has fantasy porn made of them, and all that un-important drama. I ended my mowing on one such instance beginning and it is making me not be terrible excited to return to the book. Anyway. After mowing I showed and then finished the epilog of "dreaming in code" but I didn't finish the post script to the paper back. Good enough though I'd say. I declared that book read (and then read the post script the next morning) for the purposes of my bullet journal. Played some star craft with Ben. Tried each civilization to get an idea of how each works. I think I need to watch some strategy videos though to learn a bit more about them and how to think like them.
Thursday after work was a mix of busy and relaxed. Megan and I discussed schedule and such for a while. I designed a little gardening tool and started the printer working. We had a snack and I was off to Ultimate. We are doing twice a week now to see if we can't build up our stamina. I still feel exhausted. I returned, we had supper, played TotK till bed time.
### June 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A garden that comes together more every week
2. Fun with my 3D printer
3. Things starting to calm down.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans fun birthday parties

Entry

Friday I hacked on metrics. Some day I will say something different but today is not that day. After work... Man I try not to forget but it has been a busy time. Oh, but an important thing I did accomplish was going to the Hanson's and picking up 2 more bales of straw and 6 large rocks to make a wall for Lucy's gravel pit.
Saturday I woke up. Made breakfast, we watched a video, and then I headed to the dump. After dropping off our spring trash I asked if the irrigation tile they have lying in piles was up for grabs. They said no but that there was wood chips I could have. I gleefully took 4 trashcans full of wood chips and headed to Adison's place. Myself, and mostly many others, were helping her move. I arrived late and didn't end up helping very much on the loading end. I left after helping unload most of the stuff and came home and started working on the garden. The plan for blocking weeds in the paths was 3 fold: news paper, straw, topped with mulch. These steps together should make a pretty effective and robust weed blocker that is all organic. I got the path to Lucy's garden, in front of Lucy's garden, and a little ways past Lucy's garden all done. This really improved the feeling of "done"-ness that the garden has. I'm very pleased with the look of it. but despite having 4 trashcans full of wood chips I ran out at this point having only done like 25 feet of path. I'm going to need a few more wood chips. 
I also constructed Lucy's gravel pit. "pit" being a bit of a misnomer. It's 6 large rocks, sitting on some card board for weed blocking, making a semi-circle. Then some small rocks in the front closing off the circle. This makes an enclosed-ish space where we poured 2 bags of pea gravel. It's like a sand box but is less likely to attract the neighborhood cats as a litter box. We got her some trucks to play in it.
After all that, ~4.5 hours, Megan and I were exhausted. We still have a ways to go on our garden but things are really coming together, and that is quite nice. We concluded the day of course with TotK.
Sunday I went to church early for rehearsal. The sermon was on the parables of the lost coin and lost lamb. We headed home relatively quickly since my mom was due at 11:30. But we still stopped at Hyvee to pick up some donuts for Lucy's birthday breakfast. After we got home sure enough my mom had beaten us there. We had a quiet afternoon with her. Lucy got to open presents, including a 3 foot tall paw patrol tower. She also had her first scavenger hunt with a map of our yard that Megan drew. She was struggling with the maps skills a bit but over all did pretty well. After that my mom left and we did some sunday chores and Megan prepared for Lucy's birthday party. We concluded the day with only half an hour of TotK, but we got a shrine and a Korok seed so it was pretty good.
### June 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Intimacy
2. Submersible headphones
3. Pretty graphs

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages healthy living.

Entry

More metrics. But this time I spent most of my day looking at the output. Trying to get the graphs to behave with the new metrics.
After work I worked on my bullet journal for this quarter. I'm again taking a bit of a slack position since I know I will be doing a lot of work on the garden. But the thing I am going to work on intentionally is learning unreal engine 5. I got most of the way done with the journal actually when it was time to head out for the pool. I did my lap swimming testing out my new underwater headphones. They were troublesome at first then I realized I could pass them under the strap for my goggles and after that they were rock solid. Perfect. And they served their real purpose of allowing me to stop thinking about swimming. Between listening to music and having a lap counter on my finger, I can now just let my mind wander as I swim, which makes me more likely to swim longer. In that regard these little trinkets are well worth their cost. 
After swimming, we walked home and started making supper. Lucy fell asleep before supper was ready to our great dismay. We had some time for intimacy which was a nice surprise though. We decided to let her sleep for about 45 minutes then I tried to wake her up. I picked her up, she was back down. I took her outside, asleep in my arms. I laid down in the straw with her on my chest. She rolled off and cuddled up next to me. At one point I slide out from under her and she stayed and slept a little longer on the straw. But she eventually woke of her own accord and had some supper. While she was napping though I laid down news paper on the adult seating area of our garden and got it covered with straw. At least the area that had been covered by the black tarp. Progress. But I need more news paper now. We finished the evening with TotK. 2 shrines. Got to the spring of courage, which asked us to go examine the large temple in the canyon. Ran into some bokoblins on a stage coach, that was pretty funny.
### June 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. New budget plans.
2. A pool to play at.
3. Lucy getting more fun.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a lovely family.

Entry

Yesterday I think I made good progress on my metrics work. Things are starting to come together and I think I'll have something good to show for it by the end of the cycle. 
After work I finished up my journal and got it printed. Haven't bound it yet as Megan was using her needle pouch and so I couldn't find it. We then had some snacks and went to the pool. I didn't have lap swim so I was a little at a loss of what to do. I tried water walking with Megan and Amanda but keep a group of 3 together well enough that we could all be in conversation in the loud environs of the pool was annoying so I went my own way and just walked by myself. I thought about how to update our budget spreadsheet to more accurately match what we want it to be while I walked. Had plans by the time I headed home. After swim lessons of course was Papa time since it was Tuesday. So Lucy and I stayed at the pool for another hour and enjoyed the water. She's getting big enough and social enough now that she is fun to play with. It was a pleasant time at the pool.
We headed home and had a meltdown when we got home. It was less than pleasant. Had supper. Opened presents. I worked on the budget for a little while before we relaxed with some more TotK.
Finished "Star Trek: The Original Series" and I think Megan summarized it well with "Now that I have seen the whole original series I'll be happy to get back to some TV that isn't as sexist." The last episode plot wise was rather interesting, but golly, the sexism was on full display. It had some other issues, but what ST:TOS didn't? There are some VERY bad TOS episodes. But I am glad to be done with the series too. Towards the end it was getting very dull and the show had a lot of inconsistencies and the technical details yet to be sorted out. 
### June 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Gadgets
2. A lovely garden
3. Rain

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has puzzled a little bit recently on how to deal with disdane for water on her face since Lucy seems to struggle with the same issue.

Entry

I thought I had gotten all the these I wanted handled yesterday, but to my great dismay I had a logic error that was causing pods to blow up. So we had to roll back while I figured out what was wrong. Unfortunately by the time I had figured it out, it was the end of the day. So I am hoping to have it up and running properly today.
After work we had some snacks and went off to the pool. I did lap swimming and blissfully enjoyed not paying any attention to what lap I was on or how much time had elapsed. It is very nice. After the pool we came home and chatted for a little while. Perhaps to long because by the time I got to Hyvee to pick up some supper the Deli had closed. I drove home to find Megan out of the shower at that point, we discussed, I went back out to Walmart. They didn't have any chicken either so I grabbed some frozen chicken tenders. It was about 7:40 by the time I got home. I watered the plants and went in for supper around 8:10. Having forgotten that it was Wednesday so it was game night with Ben. He sends me a message I let him know things are running a little late. We ended up only getting one game of star craft between my tardiness and Ben's internet connection lagging out for a while. But it was an interesting game never the less. We lost. So we have found our max difficulty level. Nice. Now lets see if we can master the game and push that up.
Started watching the second season of Vinland Saga last night. 
### June 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain
2. Exercise
3. Relaxation

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has gotten pretty good at video games. 

Entry

Hacking on the frontline dashboards mostly yesterday. Gotta get them up and running so I'm not causing problems.
After work was pretty busy. I worked on the budget till it was snack time. Then walked to Ultimate Frisbee, which didn't go that great as I was throughly exhausted from the past several days. I could make it I think half way through the game. After that I came home and we played TotK. A few more shrines, a few more Koroks, and most notably our first tear. 
### June 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Simplified budget
2. Garden growing
3. Sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants more children

Entry

Friday I hacked on dashboards all work day and a little bit of cleanup towards the end. I've got this week left to finish it all up.
After work I pounded on the budget. It had been a rain thurdery day so the pool was closed and we skipped doing exercise. This gave me the time I needed to get through it all. We managed to finish it all up and get to a decent "completed" state by the end of the evening. But that was April's budget. Now I need to do May's. 
Saturday morning I slept in as long as I could. Made muffins. Watched Jordan Peterson talk about Genesis. After that I fiddled for a while trying to get "Local AI" running on Udgard. Local AI is a personal instance of the generative AIs that run systems like ChatGPT. Being a local only AI I'll be able to trust it. Which is great news. And I'll be able to hit it with more complex tasks.
I also worked on the garden a bit. Got the back of the seating area covered and discovered a basil plant that was still barely hanging on back there. We'll see if it comes to anything by the end of the season. Mean while I planted the 3 basil plants that I think I started way back in January. Their growth had been stunted by limited space in their seedling pots. But for the last month or so they had been growing in a hanging planter so had some space to stretch their limbs. They were as big as the store bought ones, if not bigger, by the time I planted them. That should result in some good things.
After doing all that I was exhausted as I seem to always be these days. I fiddled with some more AI before we played video games to end the evening.
Sunday I slept in as long as I could again. Lucy was a peach. She refused to get dressed, refused to get in the car, and refused to go to children's message. We left church basically as quickly as we could to avoid her refusing to leave. Got home, had some lunch, I took a nap and Megan and Lucy headed over to Amanda's to pick mullberries. Unfortunately a storm the night before had knocked most of the ripe berries down so our harvest wasn't as rich as it could have been. But we got enough for a crisp. Headed home, I did my sunday chores since Ultimate had been moved to a different time. We played some TotK. I headed off to ultimate. I came back and we enjoyed a bonfire for the rest of the evening. Lucy played and we conversed. It was a good night.
### June 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chance to sit outside and work
2. Lovely weather
3. A healthy growing garden.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can handle Lucy well.

Entry

Now the focus is on getting all the other microservices updated with the new metrics. Charge!
After work we went swimming. My headphones were dead. It did demonstrate to me how much the lap counter mattered more than the headphones. I enjoy having the headphones, but just being able to not think about the laps was definitely the more important part of just relaxing and swimming without caring about anything. After swimming we came home, I made supper while Megan showed. Did some gardening, some of which was in the cursed bed so I showed after wards. Megan thinks she might have identified poison ivy in the flower bed so it seems it is indeed poison ivy there. Then we relaxed with some TotK.
### June 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My metrics work coming to a close
2. Lucy making friends at the playground
3. Simplified Budget

Thing I love about Megan: 
Supportive.

Entry

Mostly wrote stuff for recording a video on what I've done for people's education during work. After work we lounged and chatted a bit before we headed out to the pool. The plan had been for Lucy and I to have papa time at the pool but it was cold and Lucy wanted out before Megan was even done water walking. So we went home and came back to play on the playground. Lucy was having so much fun with a random child she met that she didn't want to eat supper. We let her go play and picked her up after we had finished supper. We got home and I started working on May's budget. After I got all the transactions into the sheet Megan jumped on and helped me label them. We got the majority of the work done before we called it an evening to play TotK. This new budget process appears to be working great. Vastly simplified.
### June 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hydrocortisone cream
2. Getting better at star craft
3. Things coming together nicely for this cycle

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty food

Entry

Monday night I did some gardening in the cursed bed and picked up the curse while I was doing such. The poison Ivy rash is not as bad as it has been in the past, just a few relatively small spots, only a few of them big enough to be weeping (like 2). But never the less I will be happy when it subsides. Freaking poison ivy.
I got my educational videos completed yesterday, still struggling to get them uploaded so I can share them. It was a fair bit of work to do so I certainly don't want to let it go to waste. The PRs for the other projects are starting to filter in to completion. Just a few left to deal with. I don't quite think I'll make the end of tomorrow though.
After work we went and swam. Came home and while Megan made supper Lucy played TotK all by herself. Sort of. She did manage to beat a chuchu with a little guidance and do a korok with me just helping her get back on top of rocks some times when she fell. So I was guiding her verbally most of the time, but she was doing most of the controlling. She's getting the feel for things and understands already one joystick makes link move, the other moves the camera around. She'll be a pro in no time.
After supper I did some catching up on correspondence and then Ben and I played Starcraft. I'm clearly getting better, as is Ben. We were able to beat a hard and a harder opponent last night. Not too shabby. We'll try for double harder next week. And then maybe we'll throw our hats into the ring for human matches.
### June 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Nice new windows
2. Tasty food
3. Fun games

Thing I love about Megan: 
Her style of playing games does encourage me to stop and smell the roses a bit more.

Entry

Yesterday was just more metrics pounding. Nothing much to talk about. After work I didn't do any exercise since I had praise band rehearsal instead. But in the time between Megan and I discussed budget and came to the conclusion that May was done. We are officially caught up. Work on some personal programming before rehearsal and then played TotK after. 
### June 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good nights sleep
2. A lovely seating area outside.
3. A day off

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has encouraged me to be creative in ideas for injecting spurts of excitement into our love life.

Entry

Friday I got everything into an inprogress state at work. Hopefully we can pin the remaining down during cool down. Friday evening I got my printer back up and running and we played some video games. Didn't go to the pool.
Saturday was a busy day. I estimated that I spent 6 hours in the garden working on the seating area. But it's done. And with it the vast majority of the garden is done. At this point it's just a matter of getting the perimiter wall done. I would also like to get some mulch for the blueberry bed around to the front of the house, but that can wait for another 2 weeks till the dump is open again. Played some TotK in the evening and called it a night.
Sunday was pretty good. Ran sound in the morning but was so tired from the previous day that I slept through the sermon. After church I had lunch and took a nap on the sofa with Lucy watching paw patrol. Happy Father's day! Then Sabrina and co showed up a little before playing ultimate so I greeted them all before I walked off to the field. It was a good game, fairly evenly matched until Brody just ran out of juice at the end. Played some Tears for a while and Lucy fell asleep. Made Salmon Pizza on the grill and got eaten alive by flies. At one point Lucy accidentally let the cat out and he never came back. Still not back this morning so we hav officially declared him a run away. After we got tired of getting eaten by flies we came in and played some more tears until we called it a night. Which was a little late since today is Juneteenth and I have the day off. Slept till 8:30.
### June 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Our kitty returning
2. A lovely day of rest
3. A nice place to sit outside in the mornings

Thing I love about Megan: 
May well be pregnant right now and we just don't know it yet. (and won't for another week)

Entry

Yesterday I slept till 8:30. I intentionally tried to stay down as long as possible since I was struggling with lethargy for a while. I hope that 9.5 hours of sleep will do me good. On a similar note my poison ivy rashes are starting to subside. Things are turning pick and when I do scratch it's not addictive or bloody.
After making breakfast I went out and sat in the new seating area and read "Design Patterns". The opening is a bit dry, I hope that once I get to the actual patterns it will become interesting but I've got a ways to go and I'm already quite behind. After that I started working on some 3D printer stuff since one of my objectives for this quarter was to get that area cleaned up. I also cleaned up my desk properly at last. Been months since I last saw the surface of it. Did lots of other random did-dads through out the afternoon just handling little things that have been a long time coming. Just before supper we went to the pool and after supper Megan cut my hair. Played Tears till bed time, managed to make great progress on the main story line we think. Hope to tackle the first boss fight tomorrow.
### June 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good cycle getting most of the metrics things done.
2. Fun times with my 3D printer.
3. A lovable little Lulu, even when she isn't so lovable.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Helps me pick good shows.

Entry

Mostly did my review video yesterday. I got lots of compliments, it seems to have come out well.
After work Lucy was asleep after a long screaming match with Megan over going potty. So Megan went to do water walking on her own, I sat and read. Gotta catch up with the design patterns book. Though I did fall asleep. It was a good doze and I felt much better after it. After that I fiddled with my printer for a bit. I may have broken my camera module to my great dismay. And there were other weird things happening with my printer last night. I hope I can sort them out. One of the ideas I've had recently is making a USB cable with no red wire to connect the pi to my printer, that should prevent the printer from attempting to draw power from the pi, which I think is part of what is going wrong. I gave up trying to get it to work and just shut it off for the night. I will continue my various organizing tasks today. After supper we did a walk around our garden examining all the plants. Then Lucy and I played Chutes and Ladders, almost legitimately. And then Lucy and I played some tears with Lucy instructing me on what to do to get Korok seeds. After that Megan joined and she did the rest of the puzzles in the water temple and I fought the boss. It was a good night.
### June 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D printer (not catching fire even though I'm paranoid that will happen some day)
2. A good review
3. Time to think in the upcoming pitch

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has developed a good mastery over foods.

Entry

Yesterday was review day. My video went over well, Always good. After lunch I had a donut chat with Brenda Hinds, our VP of HR whom I haven't talked to since I was initially hired and going through my on-boarding or since she was promoted from director to VP. It was a fun conversation have a bit of a candid talk with some one who works HR. Some of the highs and lows of the job and its perception. 
After work we got to the pool. Lucy was a good girl last night which was a welcome improvement from Monday. After we got back I played with her on and off until supper time. I had several moments of "Is what I am working on actually important?" And for most of the evening the answer was "no" So even though I wasn't wild about playing with dominos, I did because sitting on the couch poking my phone was not as important as playing with my little girl. One thing that was important I figure out though and so I did tell Lucy to wait for this one: How to pause my printer. Previously, when I was printing directly from the SD card, telling the printer to pause would make it retract the print head and turn off the hot head and heat bed. But octo print's pause is just a straight up "pause" and leaves the heat on. No so great! That's how you get fires! (or at least is kind of a possibility for one.) So I took a little time to figure out some manual over rides so we could sleep soundly this last night. I want it to automatically pause and resume with automations from Home Assistant, but I need to figure out how to tweak it's gcode scripts to properly pause before that is going to work. 
Played starcraft 2 with Ben last night. We got to the point where we could be a pair of very hards teamed up against us. We tried two difficulty levels down and played as zerg and it did not go well for us. So we have a bit more to learn about zerg. But we were making progress. I'd like us both to be able to have some good ideas about each of the races before we play online. 
### June 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun games
2. A useful dashboard
3. A successful print

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has arranged for Lucy to have a sleep over with Amanda so we can have an evening to our selves.

Entry

Yesterday I spent probably a bit to much time working on the microservices dashboard, but the results are very good. I hope people will make good use of the dashboard in the future.
Yesterday was Gamelan lunch so I ended up working till 5:00 so I could take a mid day nap despite having started work at 7:30. After work I was drosy again so I rested a little before heading off to play ultimate. I ate 20 almonds before going to ultimate. There was still nut in my mouth as I started walking. I know better than to eat before playing ultimate, what I didn't realize is how small qualifies. 22g of nuts immediately before playing ultimate was a bad plan. Next time I'll give it at least 20 minutes before I leave. 
After Ultimate it was "Video Game Night" which currently means we spend more time than every other night playing Zelda since we are playing Zelda every night right now. I explored the depths some trying to figure out how we get power cells. We got 10 crystalized changes, now we just need to get 90 more. 
### June 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good weekend
2. A clean car
3. Some lovely rain

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a smart woman

Entry

Friday I did some metrics and scaffolder stuff. We also had team bonding time by playing some star craft together. This time we were all on the same team! That was a fun change of pace. We went to the pool, came home, made supper and I played with Lucy till then. After supper I made banana bread since we were going to want to get out mid morning to get to my Mom's. Then played somemore tears.
Saturday, we got out about a half hour later than I was hoping. Then it took much longer than I expected to do the actual washing and waxing. The majority of the time was spent on the pre-wax cleaning. My buffer worked great but it did take time. We didn't get any of the bumpers done on Urbosa just as a thing that wasn't critical that I could drop for now. I'll circle back to those later. We got home, had some pizza, played some games.
The night going into Sunday I had hoped for a good nights sleep. But the wind was doing just all the wrong things to make sleep hard and then the cat was being a pain to, meowing loudly on Lucy's bed. Didn't get a good nights sleep. Woke up at 7:30, walked downstairs and read till I fell asleep again on the sofa. Church was good though. Let Ryan and Tiffany know about the full time remote position open at CE for a member care agent. Made her day. Came home and I fiddled with the gcode on my printer till I got pausing to work the way I expected it to. Played Ultimate. Played Tears. Made supper. Skipped bonfire since it was so windy. Had some intimacy, both physical and conversational, and went to bed.
### June 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good exercise swimming
2. A cycle concluding
3. My ever useful printer

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has uses for my 3D printer now. 

Entry

End of cycle clean up, nothing much to say. After work Lucy was napping so I cleaned the yard to prepare for mowing and headed to the pool by myself to do my swimming. I managed to pull of 25 laps this time. I finished lap 24 at 29:57, with the cut off being at 30:00. So I pulled it in just under the wire but I have proved I can do it. Now I just need to push myself harder to see if I can get that buffer down. My average time last night was 1:14, with my best lap at 1:07. I only need to drop my average to 1:12 to be able to be able to get all 25 laps inside of 30 minutes. Next year I certainly am going to change my tracking method from laps and heart beat to also include average and best. If I could do a full set of my best time, I could be just shy of 27 full laps. 
After swimming I did some reading and a few small chores on my computer. Then we had supper and I relaxed for a bit while before I went out to mow the lawn. After that we had some bathing and I did some more reading. No games as the even progressed in un-expected ways. Probably do some games tonight. Though I did express to Megan that I'm feeling a bit of a crunch from so much games and perhaps we should tone it down a bit. Surprising coming from me I know, but it's true. If only we had had paternity leave line up with TotK like we did with BotW. 
### June 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. A little time to figure things out
3. Coming excitement

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took care of transferring Lucy to her bed last night. 

Entry

Yesterday I worked on some dependabot alerts. That was most my day. After work we told Lucy that the pool would be pretty cold, so she agreed to skip the pool for the evening and instead to papa time at the park. We played until Lucy felt like she had hurt her hands on the fireman's pole. We headed home, had some supper and I proceeded to try tackling unreal engine. To start the first thing I needed to do was install the engine and I quickly discovered that my desktop was not powerful enough for this. My puny little 1030 GPU just could not handle the amount of hurmph needed to run the engine. This morning I am attempting to install UE5 on my work laptop, we'll see how that goes. Played some tears, found 2 more of the tears, just 2 more left to find. We also got the last of the sky view towers completed. I'm really pushing now to take on the main quest. I've had enough time mucking around and would like to actually beat the game. 
### June 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. Getting strong/faster
3. Projects coming to a close

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me.

Entry

Yesterday I did some clean up before I settled in to reading chassis. I want to know all its parts so I can hopefully find places where we could cut un-necessary code and make things a little more consistent.
After work Lucy was asleep so I went to the pool by myself. My head set worked great this time. Lets hope it works great again next week. I managed a 1 second average time improvement. If I can repeat that I might be able to get to 26 laps. After I got home we had some supper and chatted with Amanda. I really need to setup a time to chat with Nathan, it sounds like he could use some input from some one his peer. Specifically a male peer.
I started fiddling with a question last night. How many lines of code can an individual developer maintain in a year? Not how many can he write, but how many can he maintain. I think developers are less of an artist making painting that then never get touched and more like farmers cultivating fields of code. Any one farmer, even with modern machinery, can only cultivate so much farm land. So I'm trying to get a handle on that. Reason being is that is how big scaffolder can be at max. And the more we can push into scaffolder the less the other teams have to think about which increases how much they can accomplish. 
### June 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Cool weather
2. Air conditioning non the less.
3. A nice quiet evening

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is excited for adventure.

Entry

Yesterday I continued my critical examination of chassis. I wrote some tools to help me do such. I also wanted to update my MacOS software but that didn't get anywhere for some reason. :grumpycat: I need to be on version 12 at least in order for UE5 to work.
After work I got the camera working on my printer. There is still a fair bit of tweaking I need to do but overall I'm happy. It's nice being able to just take a quick peek at the machine from time to time. I read some, napped some, ate supper and went to rehearsal. Came back and we played tears. Finished getting all 12 dragon tears. We still have a number of cutscenes left to find. But we are now hot on the trail of the Rito portion of the game.
Tonight is exciting, Lucy is going for an over night at Amanda's. Her first over night away from home. That's very exciting. It will be nice to have some time to our selves. 
### July 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. The child I do have
2. A night with just myself and Megan
3. A good chat with Nathan

Thing I love about Megan: 
Speaks her mind.

Entry

Friday I tried to finish some cleanup tasks. Didn't get everything accomplished but it was a good day. 
After work we went to the pool and I played with Lucy. We had a bit of interesting progress. She was jumping off the wall to me and I would hold her out so she could swim back. She was kicking her feet right so I wanted to get her to doggy paddle. I told her to "grab the water" in front of her trying to think of a way of describing the action. She thrust her hands out in front of her and started pinching like a crab the water in front of her. At first I was like "ah darn it, no that's not right." But I considered, she's lying flat, feet kicking behind her, arms out stretched in front of here. This is actually really good! So I encouraged the behavior for the rest of the time at the pool.
After the pool Lucy was ready to go to Amanda's for the night. She got all her stuff into her wagon on her own and pulled her wagon all the way there on her own. Megan went along to talk with Amanda but Lucy was specific that Megan not help her. It was cute seeing her be all independant. After that Megan and I were a little bit a drift. No Lucy, what do we do? Megan wasn't feeling up to much as goes intimacy due to her period coming later than hoped. My escapade plans ended up getting shelved. She didn't feel to enticed by them after all which was a big disappointing. We'll need to discuss this going forward. We ended up just running to Walmart to grab some deserts and then watched the Konosuba movie. It was delightful and ridiculous. 
Saturday was nice. I made pumpkin scones and we watched our video without Lucy's interruptions for once which was nice. I then headed to the dump to pickup a load of wood chips. I estimate that it takes me about 40 minutes to do a round trip. So I only got one load in before the dump closed. Chatted with Nathan while I spread the chips about relationship stuff. It was a good conversation. We covered the things I wanted to cover, that I felt like I left dangling from previous conversations but didn't want to talk about in front of his family. After that I had lunch and headed out to session zero for our up coming DnD campaign. Made my character. Ran to the hardware store and picked up some dowels for my filament rack and a bag of quick-crete. I wanted to try to make a new stepping stone but the measurements on the drawing I had were inconsistent. I sent a message to my mom asking her to measure the stone she has so I could get a double check on whether or not my sizing was right. I'll continue that project Tuesday.
Sunday was fairly relaxed. We all went to church early and Megan and Lucy dropped me off and went to a park. Lucy ended up sitting with Megan during the service though. I don't know why she is so adamant on not going to children's church. It's basically cubbies which she loves. So strange. After church I had lunch, took a nap, and modeled a little shelf for the lucky cats I printed when I first got my printer. I saved them as a display piece but never knew where to display them. So I'm printing a little set of shelves to be said display. Went to play ultimate but it was so hot and humid that we only made it to 2:50. Played some more Totk, finished the wind temple. Passed the controllers to Megan and added another button to my pants to try to pull them in a little tighter. It seems to be working. Making these pants that are 2" bigger than my others seem to fit. My preious pairs were just a bit to small. Megan's objective for Zelda yesterday was get us our dream house. Which meant completing the Mattison quest and getting Hudson and Rhondson freed up a bit to get us access to the house. I'm a little disappointed that we only get 15 pieces to play with in our house, but I am glad that we even have the option. We don't really have the money for it right now so we need to earn some more scratch to get more pieces for our house. 
Had a bonfire as the evening cooled off a bit. Making mayo with Avacado oil is hard. Got eaten by flies again. Setup the hose on Lucy's slide to make it a water slide. I ended up putting wood chips at the bottom of the slide to soften her landing as the water made her slide a bit to quickly. I plan on some day putting wood chips all around her play set and since the grass is mostly dying in it's shadow and rain shadow anyway. It was a good weekend. 
### July 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Merica
2. Cookies
3. Patience

Thing I love about Megan: 
Gets me out of the house from time to time.

Entry

Monday was a pretty chill day. More of it was taken up than I would like by trying to fix a metrics issue in victory. Hopefully I can get it fixed and call it a day soon. After work we tried to hurry to get to the pool as a storm was coming in, we thought maybe we could get a bit of time but no luck. The pool was closed by the time we got there. This was kind of OK though since we were having Tiahrts over that evening and this gave us more time to get through supper. 
Played "Dominion" with Tiahrts which was a lot of fun. The verity the game creates is quite interesting by having decks of cards that change for every game. We played two games, did win either, but Megan one the second one soundly. 
Yesterday I spent most of the morning trying to make a concrete mold for making stepping stones. I managed to get it made and cast the first stone before we left for Sioux City. Unfortunately I was to impatient and it broke when I tried to extract it. I'll have to give these stones a fair bit of time to setup in the future. I hope to make one more before we depart for Megan's folks place tomorrow. If I'm lucky I might event get two cast.
In Sioux City we went to Lowes to look at window treatements and buy a flood light for our back yard. Then we went to Hobby Lobby and I finally got the things I need to finish last year's journal. We then tried to go to Aldi but they closed at 4 and it was 4:30 so we failed our main reason for going. woops. We never the less got some cookies and sat and enjoyed them in a park. 
Getting home we relaxed with some Zelda, making progress on the Gerudo section of the game. We have a number of things left to do but we are focusing down the main quests right now. After games we went and watched the fire works. We were very close. Close enough that some of the fire works flew over our heads. None of us had ever been that close but golly was it amazing, we want to do it again. Get as close as you physically can and the fire works get great.
### July 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A quiet evening
2. A beautiful garden
3. Fun challenges at work

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a lovely family.

Entry

Yesterday I got the victory metrics changes I needed to do done. That PR is up waiting for PQA. I got distracted in the middle of the afternoon by attempting to social engineer an AI. It was quite amusing. It was a website where your objective was to try to get the AI to share a bit of hidden information by engineering a prompt to manipulate it. Everyone is so scared of AI and yet they fail to see things like this coming. Humans adapt fast.
After work we scuttled along to the pool fairly quick so we could both spend some time there. I swam my laps and then Megan water walked. Lucy and I left halfway through since she was cold. We got home and got dressed, she watched a show while I poured another concrete stepping stone. We had supper, which was mostly left over to try to clear out the fridge, and then I played games with Ben.
### July 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Making it back from Kalona with all Amanda's stuff
2. The possibility that Megan might have a bike
3. Progress on unreal engine

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants a baby

Entry

Thursday I worked on fixing victory metrics. There was a certain level of satisfaction working on them as I'm building them off of the logs rather than influx. This is what I said needed to happen so I'm glad to have it as an example of doing such. After i finished work we didn't get out anywhere near as fast as either of us would have hoped. Megan ended up being very flustered all the way there because she felt rushed as a result of poor planning and she also had gotten a little light headed from being out gardening. But we got there at midnight and called it a night.
Friday was pretty chill. Ben and I played some star craft. I was going to offer to help Jeff with their shed but it was raining so no such activity occurred. Megan and the Ladies went local shopping. Lucy played with Josh. Saturday was much the same. Except this time I did actually get to help with the shed building. Sunday was a little more interesting since the ladies weren't off shopping. We went to a play ground and us adult children build a little village in the wood chips while Lucy chased Josh around. She has decided Josh is her favorite. It was nice to have a little bit of a respite from her.
Monday we got out about as fast as we were planning but it still really wasn't early enough. Megan had stated the intent of returning by 8-9. We returned at 10:15. I may always over estimate, but that is partially a result of her under-estimates. 
### July 12th

1. A new tablet coming
2. Hopes for another child
3. Rain

Thing I love about Megan: 
Though she prefers planning, she can just wing things at times.

Entry

Yesterday I caught up on work and trying to hammer out the issues with the victory metrics. Didn't quite get all the way there, need to do some digging into why data integrator is so slow on the post requests. 
After work I took a brief nap with Megan before we headed off to the pool. Lucy got cold so we headed home as soon as Megan was done walking. Lucy and I had a short papa time since we had a full hour of riding the swing at Megan's Grandparents place on Monday, that was exhausting. After the short papa time we had supper and I mowed the lawn and did a little gardening. The new stone paver I made came out just fine. Using 3D printed pieces to make the writing has promise, I'll need to tweak it a little more before the next paver though. We finished the evening with some TotK. We made it through the combat before the lightening temple. Now we are just trying to figure out how to get in. For bed time we started ST:Next Generation.
### July 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The last of the windows going in
2. A new tablet that will hopefully run a bit smoother.
3. Plants recovering from the nearly 100mph gust we had a few nights ago.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has finally gotten our shed down to reasonable levels of recycling.

Entry

Yesterday I spent more time than I hoped working on data-integrator as it was producing strange behavior. At the end of the day we decided to wait till today so we could have Cheryl give her opinion since this is an Optim service.
Greg and Nick came and started installing the remaining windows yesterday. 5 windows had remained and they got 2 of them done. A text from Greg a few minutes ago suggests that they might be able to get all 3 remaining windows today, which would be nice. Though I have my one on one in the study at 2, I might just go some where else during that meeting. 
After work we went to the pool. My swimming headphones had a dead battery of course. 
### July 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Greg lending me his ladder
2. Just one window left to replace
3. A good nights sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes open windows

Entry

Yesterday I pushed along my metrics PRs and I think they are either both merged or on the cusp of such. Happiness. Also had some discussion with Justin and separately Todd about chassis and scaffolder.
After work Greg left me his ladder and I replaced the halogen flood light in our back yard with an LED with two heads. All of my guesses were right and so it went very quickly. The back yard flood light is indeed controlled by hex 4 and the top button of the panel on in the dinning room. And fortunately the wires were all still good and so everything went fine. I was quite pleased. After I fixed up the light I came in and started working on getting it added to home assistant. I'm spending a little time writing a bit of tooling that I really should have written a year ago when I first installed the lighting controller. I'm making it easy to send arbitrary activations to the relay boards to help map relays to switches. I don't know which of my relays controls the lighting controller relay that powers the flood light so this is a necessary bit of help. Didn't quite finish it before I had to leave for ultimate. 
Ultimate was toasty. 91.6f. We called it 10 minutes early as I was approaching heat stroke. As we were leaving Parker commented about smart homes and I told him that I did indeed have a smart home, and that I refused to do anything in the cloud and everything is self hosted, and I tend to not trust things that have a wifi connection and I can't flash with my own firm ware. We'll see if I can get him interested in any smart home stuff. Came home, rinsed off in the shower. I could feel the heat leave me, almost painfully, as the cold water ran down my back. Boy was I hot. 
Sat down for supper and then for TotK. Working our way through the lightening temple now. After that I went back up the ladder to aim the flood light now that it was dark. We didn't really need the flood light, we've been getting along with out it for 5 years, but it's nice to not have broken things. 
### July 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Megan having a bike.
2. making some progress in design patterns book.
3. Making progress on unreal engine

Thing I love about Megan: 
Challenges me religiously

Entry

Friday I mostly updated the coms dashboard to reflect the metrics changes. That done now all that remains is getting victory back in order. For which I am seeking help. During the work day Greg and Nick finished installing the last window. All done! Now we just need them to install the trim for this project to be complete. After work we went to the pool and then in the evening I focused most of my attention on unreal engine. I switched from UT5 to UT4 and found that my desktop could hack that. Fantastic! And it has better switch support than UT5. I think this is all around a very good idea. So I set about trying to simulate tribes style skiing in UT4. I've got my character sliding but I've yet to get them to slide via gravity. Working on that one yet. 
I asked for some sex Friday night and Megan... Well she didn't say no. But I can laugh looking back on it now as easily the worst sex we've ever had. We probably need to have some discussion around this.
Saturday morning I made coffee cake. We watched the last portion of the third video of Jordan Peterson's genesis lecture. I went and got another batch of wood chips and finished chipping in the front part of our garden. I'm considering chipping in around Lucy's playset as well. To that end I have dumped a bunch of chips at the base of her slide. With the windows done everything was cleared out of the garage so I put some effort into cleaning up the garage. Made quite a bit of progress and was able to clear out some of the porch as well as a side benefit. Also got the stepping stone mold rejiggered. I'm installing the screws from the underside now. That should keep the screw heads from filling with concrete and the other problems I was experiencing. Got the first stone made with Lucy's hand prints and foot prints.
We went to the Prentis centennial celebration, but apparently they were only doing rootbeer floats for an hour. So after thinking for a bit I went home and Lucy and Megan stayed and did crafts. I then went to Hyvee to get us some icecream and we made floats at home. Capped off the evening with some Zelda.
Sunday was relaxed. Went to church and Lucy eventually went down to the children's church and stayed there till the end. She wanted us to come get her when we were back to the music but when that time came she didn't want to leave, as both Megan and I predicted would happen. After church I played with Lucy for half an hour and then we had lunch, I napped. And Lucy decided she wanted to go to Amanda's. Amanda agreed and off she went leaving myself and Megan alone. I offered some intimacy but Megan, despite feeling like she should, wasn't in the mood. So I read and she looked over old pictures. I eventually came in and tried to play halo on my computer but was styimed by all the downloads. Good grief did they up the ante on the assets for these games. The OG Halo campaign is now like 8gb. It was originally released on a CD, maybe a DVD. Halo 2 multiplayer is 40gb. Good grief people!
I ended up playing some Zelda trying to get the missing gachas. I finally found the one that dispenses lights so we can go trucking around down in the depths. We then went and picked up Lucy and went and got icecream. Lucy was quite a pain most of the way there and back. Megan didn't want to do a bonfire since it was hot. We talked her into it, which I think ended up being a bad choice. It was comfortable with out the fire, not so much with it. And then there were the flies. It overall wasn't a pleasant experience. 
We read "engineering in plain sight" inside to cool off a bit and then I talked Megan into trying out her bike. She was overall pleased with it and said we might even do another bike ride tonight. Neat! w
### July 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Another successful stepping stone cast
2. My fastest lap yet
3. A happy little Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks about things.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on the telemetry package for a while until I got stuck with a build error. Justin was out in the afternoon so I was SOL at that point. Worked on the victory dashboard since I got a tidbit of insight that helped me get unstuck.
After work we went swimming. I managed my fastest lap yet at 58.59s. Less than a minute! My average still came out to ~14s so I need to work on that yet but the fastest lap was pretty cool. I did some crawl as well. I found that crawl was not inherently faster than breast stroke, as I was pulling 1:15 laps with crawl. But I tend to default to a faster pace, thus it tends to make me faster. What ever the case I clearly am at the point where I'm going to have to start pushing for me to improve. Which sounds exhausting.
After we got home I made supper and we ate in the porch for the first time this season. The porch had been filled with junk and the table covered with planting things. I cleared the former on saturday and the latter last night so we could finally enjoy our porch again. After supper I freed the second stepping stone. We didn't have enough quickcrete to make a third so I took Lucy and went to the hardware store. Then we went to HyVee to pickup some eggs as we had run out. I got complimented for my dadding on the way out as I was playing walk straight and lifting Lucy for big jumps. The lady said she loved hearing us and to Lucy she said Lucy had a great dad. 
We got home, made the 3rd paver and I pumped up my bike tires. We tried to go on a family bike ride but Megan's seat was hurting her and Lucy was just an utter grump. We didn't even make it around the block. So we went to bed 15 minutes early.
### July 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Patients with Lucy
2. Lucy having a nap
3. Nathan as an Ally

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a sexy woman.

Entry

Yesterday I paired with Justin for a large portion of the day to work on the telemetry package. It was enjoyable getting to work with some one more familiar with typescript than myself. Still mastering that language.
After work we went to the pool. Lucy and I swam in the general area for the first hour, then she wanted to get out and wait for water walking to conclude. I expected we wouldn't be in the lazy river very long but we spent almost the entire hour there. The whistle blew while we were walking back from the tube coral. I was pleased with myself. I'm trying to put more priority on Lucy and being there when I am with her. There is nothing on my phone that matters anywhere near as much as she does, no hobby that I care about as much as I do her. So I'm trying to live that out. She can drive me nuts some times but I want to show her as much love as I can.
After we got home I did a little debugging of our internet connection, but it was upstream of us anyway so the solution was to just wait. It came on shortly after I discovered this. Helped Megan make supper. After supper I worked on my game in unreal engine. I got the jet pack working and gaining speed by sliding down hills. With that I have proven I can do all the things I want. I have made it work, now I need to make it good. And part of that is going to be creating a hilly terrain to ski across. 
### July 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A simplified budget process
2. A good swim
3. A loving God.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very creative.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on telemetry tests. It was a bit tiring.
After work I got my unreal project stored in version control. I'll need to fine tune this as I checked in ~500mb of version control, which is a bit much. and certainly most of that is un-related to the actual work I am doing. After that we headed to the pool. I managed my fastest lap yet at 57.07 seconds, but my average wasn't that great at 1:14. Even though I included 6 laps of crawl. Now that I've proven I can do a 57.07s lap I think I'll chill on my speed record for a bit and try to focus down that average a bit better. After the pool we came home and I worked on the budget before and after supper. Then Ben and I played Starcraft 2. We played an online match and thwamped them. So we decided to try ranked and got thwamped both times, but we saw strategies that were informative and will help us improve as players. 
### July 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Progress on TotK.
2. Minimal time at praise band rehearsals.
3. Completed telemetry package.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has insatiable curiosity at times. 

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on the telemetry package tests for the most part. Finally got them done at the end of the day.
After work I worked on the budget for a bit, discovered an error in the calculations, and corrected them all. Had supper. Went to rehearsal. They are using in ear monitors so I ended up doing all of nothing last night at rehearsal and asked if I could leave early, so I ended up doing such. Got home and did an easter egg hunt Lucy setup and then played some TotK. We started down the path of the final area, the Gorons. We were quite surprised to see it wasn't swelteringly hot. We got the quest started before we ran out of time. Hopefully next week or two we can work our way through it and get moving forward onto the next phase of the game.
### July 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A productive Saturday
2. A bike trailer for family biking!
3. Air conditioning

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys video games.

Entry

Friday I hacked on the redis package mostly. After work we went to the pool. I played with Lucy and a little boy her age named Elisha. It was certainly more fun having more than just myself and Lucy to play with. After the pool we went home, Lucy was very sad about that, had some supper, and I forget what I did. I really need to get better at remembering friday evenings.
Saturday I made pumpkin muffins and we started watching Peterson's lecture series on marriage. It's an interesting one. Then I headed out to the bike store to drop off Megan's bike and then to the lumber yard to order some lumber for our new room spanning book shelf. Then I took my study door off it's hinges to start the process of staining and finishing it. I also stained the boards for the book shelf. I also started ripping the trim off of the garage doors. I'm going to replace all the rotted bits and repaint and seal it all. Got the bike side stripped of it's old stuff so far. It will take some doing I think to do it and do it right. So I'm going to try to be patient as I work on this. 
Sunday was pretty low key. Went to church. Came home. Played some ultimate and over heated again. Played some TotK, supper, more tears, went on a walk.
Megan's period arrived this morning to our great dismay. Still no baby.
### July 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A loving God, a hope for a future
2. A comfortable bed
3. A good job

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a great teacher

Entry

Worked on the redis package yesterday. Got side tracked by some red herrings so I didn't make as fast of progress as I would have hoped.
After work we went swimming. I was clearly quite tired as I merely managed 1:18 for my average lap time, 4 seconds slower than where I have been. I did do a sprint on my second lap, this time in crawl instead of breast stroke, and established that the fastest I can swim is a 49 second lap. Not bad. But I think I need to stop doing these sprints and focus on trying to get that average time down. After swimming I took Lucy and we went to the hardware store so I could pick up some varnish for the study door (and living room book shelf), amongst other things. We got home, I varnished the door while Megan continued supper prep. After supper I mowed the lawn and by then I was very exhausted again. I sat down and played games for the half an hour that remained till bed.
### July 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A pool to swim in when it is super hot
2. Projects coming along nicely
3. A lovely garden

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of me and Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday I fought mightily with typescript. Gave up after a while. It's rules can be very obtuse some times.
After work I changed into my swimsuit and then went out to sand the study door to prepare it for the next coat of varnish. I got sweaty just standing there gently sanding. It was very hot. We then went to the pool and I stayed for papa time after Megan finished water walking. Lucy had a lot of fun for the full two hours. Which seems to be about the time Lucy takes to be satisfied with pool time. She rarely complains at our departure after two hours. Though the natural cut off of the life guards clearing the pool certainly helps with that. 
After we got home. Had supper. Watered plants and varnished the door. That took quite a bit of time. It was 8:45 at that point so I settled down and did some work on my game in unreal engine. I figured out what I need to do is setup a custom movement mode, that should solve most of the peculiarities of my current movement. But I ran out of time just as I was discovering this and how to do it so I put it down for the night. Hopefully I'll have some more time some time this week.
### July 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A pool on a hot day again
2. Patience
3. The opportunity to play halo on my desktop

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes us out to fun events some times.

Entry

Yesterday I finished up the feature flags package but found out that my hack to get around service meta not behaving is breaking things so I will need to really dig into it to figure out what is going on. 
After work we vacillated for a bit on whether or not to go to the pool, Lucy was very excited and interested so we ended up deciding to go for it despite the heat (it did peak at just a hair over 100f yesterday). She does love that pool. And she is starting to warm to the water in a lot of good ways. After my lap swim, which was cut short to clear the pool for the cardboard boat race, she was jumping back and forth between me and the wall again, but notably she was visibly holding her breath (puffing out her cheeks) so that her mouth stayed shut as she jumped and her face dipped into the water. That is very good. 
We stayed for the card board boat races. The homeschoolers did very well as per usual. Lucy was in-tranced by it. She won't yet be old enough next year, but the year after she'll be 6 and able to join in. Which is good because at the rate we are going she won't yet have learned to swim by next year. Hopefully when she is 5 we will be able to push a little more and convince her to do swim class.
After we got home I did a few small things and then sat down to play games with Ben. We tried playing the Halo campaign but it would seem I need to setup port forwarding in order for that to work. That... was unexpected. So I will try to setup port forwarding between now and next week. I also want it setup for playing Halo with Brady on Saturday so I have extra incentive. 
### July 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Air conditioning on these roasty toasty days
2. Lucy having fun with planes
3. Getting unstuck at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes Lucy on field trips.

Entry

Yesterday I had two problems I was stuck on. Todd helped me get unstuck on the Github Actions one. In conversation with him I also saw what was at issue with my chassis import problem. Yesterday I discovered how typescript/javascript imports work and most notably how they are very different from python imports. Some assumptions that were made turned out to not be true so I'm going to have to figure out how to manage them.
After work I sanded the study door in preparation for the second coat of varnish on the second side of the door. I hope to have this done by Saturday. After that we kind of just bunkered down inside because it was hot. I didn't play ultimate because 95f was a little to hot for that. I tried figuring out how to deal with the halo port forwarding working on my computer so I could play co-op with Brady and Ben. No luck. Frustration. 
Played some Kerbal with Lucy last night to give her the opportunity to try flying an air plane. She had fun. Megan got some video of it.
Played Tears to finish off the evening. We found a "secret tunnel" from look out landing and went spelunking. It ended up taking up basically the entire evening. It was a huge hidden cavern that just kept going. Took us all the way to the castle. Didn't end up having any significant fights outside of the stalnox though. But most importantly we found an entire collection of new armor. :success:
### July 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A fun weekend getting to see the air show.
2. Justin's return so I can pick apart what he was planning.
3. A good date night.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Arranged for Lucy to go to Amanda's so we could have a date night.

Entry

Friday I cleaned things up a bit and pushed my PRs. Started working on the Open API PR. After work we went to the pool and had a date night. Lucy went to Amanda's. It was the last of the burger battle burgers for us. I was glad we did r-pizza, they had the best.
Saturday we got up and out relatively promptly to get off to the air show. Just as we were pulling out of the garage my Mom called to let me know that my Uncle Tom had passed away. She was pretty shaken of course loosing her brother. We explained it a little to Lucy and I'm glad we take the opportunities like this when we have them. We told her that my uncle had died and she said we can see him with God along with all our other babies; since Lucy's understanding of death has largely come from our miscarriages. It's good to hear she is so stable in her faith for her young age.
It was a long day at the air show. A lot of standing in line waiting. But it was over all enjoyable. We got home and I finished up varnishing the boards that are going to make the long shelf in our living room and then we played TotK until I got on to Halo with Brady to finish out the evening.
Sunday was pretty chill. We went to church, Lucy is finally going to kids message for the whole of the service, with just this and next week left in the summer. *eye roll*. We relaxed at home and chatted a bit. After lunch I went off to play ultimate, we called the game half way through due to thunder. Played TotK until it was time for supper prep. Grilled a pizza. We did a bon fire but spent most of the time over in the garden examining what is going wrong with our pumpkin vine. We seem to have an infestation. So we cleared out a bunch of vines and hoped that we can save some of the pumpkins. 
Justin is back, hopefully that can get me unstuck on some of the things I was stuck on last week.
### August 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Completing the stepping stone project
2. Megan having a bike!
3. The possibility of some guidance from some one else doing a game similar to mine in unreal engine.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a remarkable amount of patience with Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday I finished the OpenAPI package and then screwed up the rebase some how and blew it all away. Very frustrating, but I was able to re-build pretty quickly thanks to having done it once already.
After work we went and picked up Megan's bike. It took a lot longer than we had hoped. But it is all set and ready for Megan to ride. As we were departing for the bike store Lucy started throwing a fit out of no where. She said she was angry and nobody, not even her, knew why. She was fairly good while we were at the bike store, probably due to it's novelty, but once we got home she was a little monster again. She and Megan ended up staying home from the pool. By the time I got back from the pool Lucy had apparently calmed down but was now back to throwing a fit. She fell asleep while whining. I took her upstairs. Brought her back down a while later for supper and she was still whining. At bed time she was throwing her animals and kicking Megan while we were lying down trying to watch a show. It was quite an evening. Here's hoping today is better.
Before and after supper I was working on unreal engine. I got frustrated and have turned to the forums to try and figure out how to get good skiing working. Just my luck some one else is attempting something very similar so I have sent a message asking how he did it and we'll see if that can get me un-stuck. 
After that I did some weeding in the garden. We made Megan's hand print stone, and then we fiddled with Megan's bike and went for a short bike ride all together. Lucy has been really enjoying riding in the trailer. Megan and I enjoy that we can move at our speed rather than Lucy's fall on the ground screaming speed. 
Looking at my charts for various things, like swimming, running, weight lifting. I seem to get to a certain point and then get stuck there. It is making me wonder about my personal drive. I don't seem to be all that driven to excel, just driven to go to the edge of my natural abilities and no further. And I fear this is a common thread in my life. I hit that point with music, both harp and horn. I have hit that point at times with programming. With drawing. Many aspects of my life I feel like I've hit my natural limits and I just don't have the drive to push beyond. There is part of me that is very sad by this, am I not the kind of person who can over come his limits? This might be why hearing about things like the marine training from extreme ownership appealed to me since I might need an external force to get me to push up over that limit. 
Alternatively, do I want to be that kind of person? More and more I'm starting to feel like the answer is "no". I'm not the kind of person who would make the immense sacrifices to strive above and beyond is what it seems. Or at very least not right now. I've been trying to push back against some of these forces in my life. Does learning to make a game, cleaning the garage, having a garden, matter more than spending time with Lucy? With Megan? Do I want to be Stripe, or do I want to be Bandit? 
Bumping in against this also I feel how I want to do fewer things better. Rather than picking up a new hobby every quarter I want to focus in on what I've got and really do it well. This actually goes against what I was just saying so it's an interesting back and forth now that I think of it. Be also a realization of the limit of my time. I think I will some time push to accel beyond my limits in something, but I am going to need to pick that something well and have a really good motivation for doing such.
### August 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy getting to play with her Aunt Natalia
2. Progress on chassis packages at work
3. A nice overcast day.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Initiated a deep conversation about us and sex on the way home.

Entry

Worked on chassis package stuff. Bounced between mine and Justin's.
After work I cleaned for a robot and read a bit and snoozed a bit. We had supper and then headed out to Orange City to see Natalia. Lucy and Natalia got a long quite well. It was a fun evening. Natalia genuinely seemed to be doing quite well.
### August 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Sleep
2. A new tablet that is much faster
3. Perseverance

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a lovely woman.

Entry

More chassis at work. I'm realizing I need to cut down again on media intake. I'm going back to no new morning. Let at least my morning be distraction free.
After work we went to the pool. After my recent thoughts on whether or not I can push beyond my natural limits I decided to give it a try yesterday. Technically I failed. I wanted to get to 26 laps but I still failed to push beyond 25. Perhaps if I had pushed harder in that last lap I might have been able to come in under 30 minutes to complete 25 laps, but I did finish the 25th lap at 30:09, which is a record. I achieved, rounding down, 1:12 seconds per lap. I believe it was 1:12:39. Those 9 seconds are all that stood between me and dropping it below 1:12. So I'll try again monday, maybe I can push beyond, but I have to try. I have to actually push myself to do it. And I have to focus.
After that we came home, made supper, I tried to get online multiplayer co-op working on my computer but had no luck. So Ben and I just played online skirmishes. 
### August 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chance to meet up with some of my former colleagues from USD.
2. Cycle work speeding up as we close on the last week of the cycle.
3. Cooler days returning.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes care of Lucy for me.

Entry

Yesterday I continued work on chassis-packages. We are coming to the end of this project now.
After work I lazed about for a bit. Amanda was here regaling us with some of the goings on at USD. After that I suited up as the grim reaper and went to Kyle Gruhn's 50th birthday party. It was enjoyable to get to see several of my old co-workers and chat about how things are going. I spent the most time chatting with Andy McNamara about children and housing. It was enjoyable, I'm glad I went.
Got home and we played TotK. Made some progress on the central story, discovered clues to getting into the Korok forest and managed to get there just as it was time to go to bed. 
Lucy wet her bed in the middle of the night. She had managed to stay dry all night the night before so we let her go again without a pull up. Unfortunately we didn't have a repeat success. When Lucy came to our bed at 3 in the morning Megan discovered the problem and went to tend to the wet bed. I asked her if she needed assistance and she said no, in doing so graciously let me sleep.
### August 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A trip to the zoo and time hanging out with Brady.
2. Good discussions with Megan
3. Interesting App ideas.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks lots of thoughts.

Entry

Friday hacking on chassis. Getting done what can be done. After work we went swimming. After that I took Lucy on a bike ride to the hardware store. We went there to get a bag of concrete. We weren't sure at first if the trailer would support the weight but it did it like a champ. It was pretty entertaining. We got the concrete of course because I wanted to make one more stepping stone and this time be sure the NFC tags got into it. I put two tags on the stone, on on top one on bottom. Both reported working after extraction the following day so we are looking good. We'll see how they winter. I like the tag on the bottom as it is more obvious it's there, though it has the problem of being exposed. 
I didn't get as much done on Friday as I would have wanted, but what I did do was good and I spent time with Megan and Lucy and these are good things. I feel like my priorities were in order.
Saturday I made chocolate zucchini bread for breakfast and it took a while. Lucy woke up, came to our bed, and started thrashing in bed so Megan was forced to wake early for a Saturday morning. That was less than desirable. After breakfast we had a little time before we headed off to a block party hosted by Resilient church. It was enjoyable, chatted with various people. Then we headed home and I changed the trailer hitch over to Megan's bike and Megan got her first experience biking with trailer and she reported it wasn't to bad. While she was gone I worked on the garage trying to get the trim sorted. I got the PVC blocks made and glued onto the boards that are going to be the new base of the garage door door frame. I decided to let them sit until next time I made effort so that the bond could be as solid as possible. In the mean time I finished the day by working with Megan to arrange the vehicles in the bike side of the garage. We put tape down to try to enforce the order to stay. We also in the process defined the "workshop" area of the garage. Having this smaller area should force me into a position of keeping it in better order. I'll be working on that next week. I won't finish for sure, but I'll make progress. I am taking the attitude of "clean desk" and "clean garage" being "cleaner" not "fully clean" and it make the task less daunting and more likely to get done as a result. I'm not aiming for perfection just a little less chaos.
Sunday was wet and rainy. Which was rather delightful. We got shanghaied into a baby shower after church, but we were happy enough to do such as a form of out reach to the international student who had only been here two weeks. After that we relaxed at home a bit. Probably a bit to long. And then prepared for our trip to Omaha. I dropped the ball in a number of ways on the Sunday afternoon prep time and delayed our departure. Over all I need to get better at making things less stressful for Megan when it comes time to prepare for departures like these. 
Monday was exhausting. We went to the Omaha Zoo and keeping Lucy from falling apart all day was a bit of an exercise. But it was fun going with Brady and Co. and getting to meet some of Julie's family. Brady and I had some good conversations, and we even got home at about 10 which wasn't toooo late. :success:
### August 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Simplified Budget
2. A good nights sleep
3. A nice summer

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of Lucy.

Entry

Got more done on chassis. I think we should have all the packages done by the end of the day today.
After work we walked over to the high school for a block party sort of thing hosted by sanford. It was enjoyable. But Lucy didn't need to chaperones so I headed home and started working on closing out our monthly budget. Took longer than I wanted and by the time we were done it was 9. But we did get it done in an evening and I wrote some scripting to speed it up next month. This scripting will be a lot more reliable than the others because I'm not web scraping, at least not yet. I want to get it to auto populate the amazon transactions so that is going to be some web scrapping but that shouldn't be an issue, the amazon one always worked well. 
Played some TotK trying to get a little more of the depths explored. I had my first fight with a frox. It went well. I was pleased. 
### August 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Effort
2. Our lovely garden
3. A lovely home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is not likely to leave me.

Entry

I got the last package made, but I still need to finish writing tests for it.
After work Megan and Lucy were still off getting groceries so I fiddled in the garage a bit. I tried using wooden pegs to make a perfect joint between two of the boards for the room long bookshelf, but alas, I do not have that level of accuracy. So I'm thinking at this point that I'll just use 3 brackets per board and have the brackets try to hold the boards close to keep the seem minimal. It should be pretty good. I'm hopeful.
Lucy was not listening to Megan so she lost pool privileges. I went to the pool by myself. And I pushed. I pushed as hard as I could, which was hard to do over time. It's an interesting note. Pushing, being motivated, for an instant is easy. Prolonged motivation is hard. But I managed to pull it off this time. I got all the way to 26 laps. My average time was 1:10.93. I was aiming for 1:10, largely because the mental math was easy for keeping track of where I was, but it was also good that it meant I was aiming 2 seconds higher than my actual goal. But those details aside. It was proof to me that I can improve. I have 6 more visits to the pool left this quarter. It will be my objective in this remaining time to try and get to 27 laps. That means I need to drop my time down to 1:09. I made an improvement of ~1 second since my last time swimming Aug-2. If I can keep that up, I could get two 27 laps in two more visits. If I can really keep it up I could make 28 laps before the end of the year. Not likely, but hey, that's not a winning spirit huh? I want to know if I can push, this is a silly, simple thing, but it is simple, it is measurable, it is hard. I will be able to stand on this in the future to make some sort of statement about my abilities later.
After I got back, I did some gardening and picking tomatoes with Lucy. I trimmed back a bunch of things mostly. It's a bit crazy that our garden is so lush that we have to reduce it to keep it in check. Had supper. Dug a new compost hole, took a shower. Played Halo with Ben.
### August 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Cool showers
2. Bikes
3. Windows making progress again

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is doing a good job of getting us out to community events this year.

Entry

Finished the last chassis package. Now working on getting MSs over to chassis.
Nick came yesterday mid afternoon and started working on the window extensions upstairs. He got the four in our bedrooms done so we can start thinking about blinds and curtains. That will be nice. 
After work I went to the fair, meet up with Megan and Lucy and had supper. They supped after me at the big bbq, but I was going to Ultimate so I left earlier than that would have allowed. Ultimate was rough as usual, it wasn't scorching hot but it was hot. After I got home I took a shower to rinse off the sweat and try to cool down a bit. We played Tears until the end of the evening. Lucy fell asleep in my lap. She had a long day with hours of bouncing in bouncy castles.
### August 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A relaxing sunday
2. Cough drops
3. Cool weather, if only for a day.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Teaches kiddos Sunday school

Entry

Friday was a bit of a mad dash but I got everything at least started. We'll see if I can finish up during cooldown.
After work we went swimming and when I returned home I realized I really needed to go mow the lawn, it had been 3 weeks. So mow I did. It took me quite a while, and then I really needed to trim afterwards, particularly to edge the side walks. It was 9 before I was done with everything and I accidentally cut one of our solar lamps in half in the process. Woops! So I designed a new post quick in freecad and managed to get a replacement printed by Sunday evening after 4 fitting tests.
Saturday was relatively relaxed in the morning but then we headed out to the "Washington Pavilion" with my Mom and had lunch at Chik-fil-a on the way. Lucy had fun at said children's museum and conked out of the way home.
I had received an email from Kees-Jan. It sounds like there isn't much that can be done to save their marriage at this point, but hopefully I can at least play a roll in saving his soul and reducing the damage done to the children. These thoughts have been on my mind all day sunday after chatting with my Mom on the way home saturday.
### August 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Family bike rides
2. Progress on unreal engine
3. A working AI running at home.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has lived for 31 years today!

Entry

Yesterday I worked on client api, it was a bit of a grind and I didn't finish. Will do more today.
After work I wasn't feeling up to the pool and neither was Megan so we skipped it and had an earlier supper. After supper I played with Lucy for a bit and made preparations for Megan's present. Then we went on a family bike ride. Lucy got on and off several times, which was a bit annoying but I'm glad to see her develop with her strider. She had a couple of incidence where she seemed to fall intentionally which was a bit silly, but she also seemed to be pushing her abilities for balance so I can't complain to much. Hopefully she'll be able to bike on her pedal bike by next year.
After that I settled down to work on unreal engine. I got my hackish skiing working again and then set about trying to get other parts of my proof of concept working. I made a new map, a long skinny one and created a cube as a target. So far no luck though on getting the cube shootable. Right now the "bullets" just bounce off. I need to figure that out. I might just be able to get something pieced together by the end of this month but it's going to be tight. Never the less I have learned things about myself in the process.
Another little note. During the work day I finally got Local AI working and now have a gpt4 AI running on my home server. :success: This AI of course I can ask anything of with out concerns of leaking confidential information. I need to work it up to something more useful yet but I'm tickled to have the proof of concept up! Hopefully I'll be able to insert a GPU one of these days.
### August 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Megan's birthday!
2. A fun end of cycle game time.
3. A coming entmoot here in a month and a half.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has lived 31 years!

Entry

Hacked on client api mostly yesterday trying to get it moved over to the new chassis. In the afternoon had delta game time. 
After work I made some frosting for Megan's cake as an appetizer. Then we went to the pool. I and Lucy stayed after for Papa time. Only 2, maybe 3, more papa times at the pool before they close for the year. They have changed their schedule and now there is no lap swim. >:( I may still do breast stroke since it involves diving under water which would get me past the rope crossing the middle of the pool, but still, it's annoying. Maybe I'll do water walking instead.
After the pool we came home and had a really late supper because Megan and Amanda stood outside and chatted until Lucy and I got home. But that's quite alright. Even still went along nicely. Megan started playing Animal Crossing, which I got her for her birthday. Then we scooted off to bed.
### August 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. One last lap swim for the year
2. The lords safety
3. A stable family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is caring about others.

Entry

Yesterday I focused on client API and got through all the errors I think I can get through by myself. I'll need to discuss with Justin what is left to do.
After work I played some generals just biding my time till I left to go to the pool. Lap swim concluded for the year but I figured I could still do lapswim during the open swim, I would just have to duck and weave through the crowd. It worked ok but I can't really push myself in such a condition so I'm planning on calling last night the final lapswim of the year and next week I'll just take Lucy to the pool to play on mondays and wednesdays. She and I will get a lot of quality time at the pool together next two weeks.
After I got home I did a few things on my computer checking stuff of my check list and then we had supper. After supper I tried getting assistance with my xbox networking issues and had no luck. But I'm in the r/techsupport channel now and hoping some one will see my post and have some ideas.
Played some halo with Ben and things went over all rather well. We even won a few. Though we ran into some people who were heavy glitch abusing and toying with us. That wasn't fun.
Went to bed and around 12:30 in the morning were awoken to a woman screaming "Some body help me." We called 911 and tried to get some assistance to what seems to have been a domestic dispute but by the time the police arrived the man of the couple seemed to have taken control of the situation. The couple disappeared, we assumed they most have gotten home but after the police disappeared Megan spotted the couple walking down the side walk, so they had been hiding from the police. They seem to have come from 323 S Plum, an apartment duplex that is always bringing in the most questionable people to our neighborhood. Basically any time there is an issue on our block that duplex is the source of it. 
### August 18

Things I'm thankful for


1. Nice weather to play ultimate
2. A pretty good night's sleep
3. Hopes for another child.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of me.

Entry

Yesterday I did a couple things, but it still ended up being mostly Client API after I made my review video.
After work I got on with a tech support person from microsoft and tried to resolve my networking issue so Ben and I can play the halo campaigns together. Spent an hour there but didn't get the problem resolved. I might try again tonight, we shall see.
Biked off to ultimate since the highschool fields were busy. I did establish last night that the previous games I had were I had felt nauseous were most likely due to over heating. Last night I was tired, had side splints the last half the game, but I never got nauseous. It was also much cooler so that seems pretty indicative to me.
After I got home Megan was still working on supper because she realized we needed to garden while the weather was nice so she went out and harvested a bunch of tomatoes and corn and such. I continued some of these activities to assist getting supper ready soon. We didn't get to games until about 8:30 so it was a pretty short game night.
### August 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Friends
2. A book shelf completed
3. That it wasn't as hot as it could have been.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Still holds out hope for another child.

Entry

Friday I hammered on client API after the cycle review. Getting close on client API, but I've still got a few things left to get sorted. 
Friday evening... What did I do... Oh yes, I worked on unreal engine 4. I technically have a proof of concept for my game working now. It's not terribly impressive but I did get it all the way to fruition. So, that's happy yes? There are a lot of parts of it that do not work anywhere near as well as I was hoping, so I am over all very disappointed. I might see if I can do some refining this week, but we have plans for most nights of this week so we shall see. If nothing else it will serve as a good point of discussion this coming weekend.
Saturday I made us breakfast and we ate outside in our garden. It was nice. Then I got to work on the garage door. I managed to get new bits of the door frame in place and attached the new stone mold trim. Perfection! Well, sort of. I am going to circle back to it and see if I can't improve some of the edges and try to get the transitions smoothed out a bit so it's a little less obvious. Some of it will be hidden once I put up the new weather strip. But the parts that are still visible I'd like to make it the sort of thing where you notice it if you look closely. I think that's probably the best I can manage. But the important thing for saturday's adventure is that I got the trim up and caulked this time so it will stay dry on that seam. On that front I just need to clean up the caulk and paint the things to be done there. The other thing I got done was two of the book shelves for Megan. We now have an upper wall shelf in our living room serving as an entire bookshelf without taking up any floor space. :success:
Saturday evening was the first round of Skylar's DnD4e campaign he set up. We got through 2 fights. It was enjoyable and lasted about 3.5h. I think I did a good job keeping up with everything.
Sunday came. We went to church for the morning service. Lucy was being a wiggly one so I retreated to the cry room. While I was there I adjusted the mix since it lacked any and all vocals during the worship songs. Had a donut, went home. Prepared for a conversation with Kees-Jan. Went back and picked up Megan and Lucy. Came home. Had lunch. Had nap. Prepared the remaining two shelves to go up into the living room. Had a good conversation with Kees-Jan. Though it saddly sounds like there is not likely anything that can be done at this point to save their marriage. It makes me very very sad. I shared some of the challenges and problems I went through after my folks got a divorce. Hopefully he'll be able to help his children through the issue.
After that we played some tears, I did most of my sunday prep work but then Lucy pulled me aside for a bit because she wanted me to play Animal crossing because Megan had left me a "vaulting Poll" so I would be able to setup my tent across the river out side of the crowded initial area. I played a little with Lucy. We made supper. Ate. Lucy had a melt down. We went on a bike ride and got some ice cream. There won't be many more of those this summer. 
No baby this month. :c
### August 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Some time to focus with Megan
2. A pretty good night's sleep
3. Plans for hope and a future

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants kids how ever we get them.

Entry

Yesterday I felt pretty distracted at work. I got some things done but not as much as I feel I really ought. 
After work we went to the pool. It was pretty quiet at the pool so I ended up lap swimming. Theoretically tomorrow would be the last time I would lap swim if available. Next week, even though the pool will still be open, I'll likely fore go it just to make life a little simpler.
After the pool we came home and had supper before sending Lucy off to Amanda's. Then we nuckled down and got to some paper work. Something like 12 pages of adoption paper work we had to go through. I feel like we are tempting fate here, which is kind of positive in a way. If starting the adoption process is what it takes to get Megan pregnant, then I'm game. But it will be nice to have the backup plan so to speak. It was a lot of paper work. It took us a solid 2 hours to get through it all and we had some good discussions along the way. Turns out we are pretty open to most things. I started describing it in terms of "challenge coins" where each thing individually we were fine with, but when you start stacking things is when we start to be concerned about what we can handle. 
### August 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good summer as we come to a close
2. A good air conditioning unit (it ran most of the day yesterday)
3. The garage door project coming to fruition.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has so many thoughts and plans.

Entry

Yesterday I was a bit all over the place, but rudely discovered that Justin was taking 2 more days of PTO so all of my piling up questions are going to just sit and flounder for yesterday and today. Troublesome.
After work we went to the pool. Lucy and I spent the whole two hours there till the pool closed. She will miss the pool here in a few weeks but I think she is also getting to the point of being satiated. 
After the pool we had supper, and then I went out and did some painting on the garage door to try to keep that project inching along. I got the blue color painted down onto the trim and tomorrow I'll start the probably many many coats of pink onto the trim. Particularly if I need to cover up the darker blue that I just painted up onto the trim. I did this intentionally since I figured that would create just one more layer of rain protection. 
Did some goofing off until bed time.
### August 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Another shot at conceiving a child coming up. 
2. A good job
3. A lovely home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages me. Whether she means to or not.

Entry

Yesterday I got stuck on a number of things. But I managed to make some progress on understanding our logging pipeline, that's good.
After work Lucy and I went to the pool. We stayed there for an hour before coming home. Just one more week before the pool closes for the year. After we got home we had some supper. After that I picked some tomatoes before I put the sprinkler on. I picked 6lbs of tomatoes. quite the hull. I'll try to make some canned crushed tomatoes this weekend. After that I taped off the garage door so I could start putting on the coats of trim paint. It's going to take many coats.
Played some Halo with Ben. Lamented that we can't play the campaign together. I still really want to figure that one out.
### August 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Being part of a DnD campaign that seems to be going well.
2. The garage trim coming along.
3. A good job even if I don't feel like I'm accomplishing much some times.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a very attractive woman.

Entry

Work didn't go great yesterday. Slammed my head into walls some more. I finally got going with editing the logging pipeline and to the best of my knowledge, I don't seem to be able to edit the actual data flowing through said pipeline. I'll need to dig into why tomorrow, but golly was that frustrating. I final felt like I was going to accomplish something then it went no where. :c
After work I lounged for a bit then went outside and did some work. put another coat of paint on the trim for the bike door. I think just another coat and I may be done. I think after I finish it though I might do some fining work. I would like to clean up some of the rough edges a bit.
After that I went and did some weeding in the garden. I was noticing that the marigolds around the AC unit were getting over shadowed by the grass so I pulled all that up to give them some space. Then then just did various other bits weeding in that general area. The grass and ivy have gotten a little out of hand. I'm not opposed to these plants persay, but if I let them run wild then the area will just revert back to being yard basically. And the whole point is for it to be garden. So I pulled a bunch to at least dampen their excitement.
Played some Tears last night. Got the final sage. Not sure what to do next as Megan went around doing side quests. We are getting close to the end, there can't be much more left. 
### August 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The end of a good quarter
2. Hope for a future
3. Cool weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Helps me think through things well.

Entry

Friday I felt like a crash and burn. The cycle didn't come to a particularly great end as I didn't finish the client api migration. I spent a long day hacking on the logs coming through fluent bit with out achieving my objective or redacting passwords. It just over all was not happy. 
After work I read some more DnD book and then we went to the pool. After the pool and supper I read some more DnD trying to get to the end but running out of time is I also was doing a few other household chores along the way.
Saturday I made a chocolate zucchini oatmeal bake for breakfast and we had a nice casual saturday morning. I got to the bike shop and picked up lights and a new seat for myself. I decided to stick with the grips I've got as the one on the right is feeling less sticky and aweful as I use it more. I expect it should be back to normal soon. I finished up mounting the lights just in time to head off to DnD. DnD went pretty well. I took a lot of damage as a Palidin ought, though surprisingly my high AC didn't save me very often. That was kind of annoying. They also liked the figurine I 3D printed for myself so I'll be printing everyone a figurine for next time. Fun!
Got home and tackled the things that needed to get done first. I mowed the lawn. Then I washed the car. Then we hide 13 more koroks around the car in all sorts of hiding spots. It was great! I did my best to check everything off of my weekly tracker. And then in the evening I played Halo with Brady. We were having problems with his controls. I setup a round of play for the two of us on Hang 'em High and we were very close. I ended up winning due to a hustle right at the end with the rocket launcher. 
Sunday was pretty relaxed. Went to church and Lucy was fairly well behaved with her button books and new head phones. After church I chipped away at cleaning the garage. I have pushed choas back into just a corner of the garage. I hope to get it all cleared out and organized before winter. I also got blinds up on our bedroom. The windows are still not done, but I had a sample piece of trim and I used it to place the blinds based on where I expect the trim to be. I just got a message suggesting we might have the rest of the trim coming in this week. I will be so happy to finally have everything done. 
Went back to church for the church BBQ. Frankly I would say we kind of failed it since we didn't really talk to anyone. It wasn't to hot but the sun was beating down on everyone. I hope it went well for other people though. After church we took a short nap and then Megan and I discussed furniture arrangement in the guest room. I managed to talk her into accepting the queen bed from my mom after we figured out how to get it into the room in a way that wasn't going to be annoying. We then played some Tears, making a small tick of progress. We've got 3 stamina wheels now and 5 full cells on our power cell. We will have some exploring in the depths to do next. 
After games I started my sunday chores. The first batch of crushed tomatoes was made yesterday. 6 jars. We'll hopefully have at least 3 more batches of such before the end of the year. Considering it is only August 28th, That seems VERY likely. Ended the day with a pizza and then a bonfire. We discussed the last quarter. The discussion was heavy on me as I worked through my thoughts about Unreal Engine. This coming quarter is the holiday season so I have decided my focus will be primarily on the holidays and refining things that are partially completed at this point. My website, my computer, the server mounting in the basement, etc etc. 
### August 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun D&D figurines and general fun with my printer
2. Excitement about the coming quarter
3. A fun summer at the pool, but the time at the pool coming to a close.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a sexy sexy Von Neumann machine.

Entry

Yesterday was a pretty good start to the quarter. The first and foremost task I have already gotten to the point where I am waiting on my stake holders so things are going great!
After work we had supper before going to the pool so Lucy and I could enjoy the sprinklers and lazy river. Just 3 days left at this point. Today, tomorrow, and Friday. I'll be happy to be done as I've had my fill of the pool, but it has been great to have. After we got back I mostly worked on my journal for the coming quarter. I'm getting excited. I also printed out a bunch of DnD figurines for our campaign.
A little after 8 we went off on a family bike ride over to Tiahrts. They had left a switch game that they wanted to bring on their forth coming big trip so we biked over to drop it off. We also stopped by the library on the way back. Lucy sat in the trailer and read said book to be returned most of the way there and to the library. Of course at that point it was to dark to read so it was fine to drop off the book. But it made us realize that bringing a book is a good way to keep her happy in the trailer while Megan and I get to stretch our legs a little more. I still want to make some hooks to hold up Lucy's bike on the back. This had been a convenience idea at first since getting her bike in and out is annoying and difficult. But last night we actually went far enough that her bike was starting to fall out as we rode so it has become an actually useful thing to have hooks that won't let the bike slip.
### August 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Another completed bullet journal
2. Excitement for the coming quarter
3. A good time with Lucy last night

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is cozy cuddly.

Entry

Yesterday I got a decent start on the day. Learned a fair bit about GHA actions. I was satisfied.
After the end of the work day Lucy declared she didn't want to do the pool for papa time. It's good to hear that she has had her fill of the pool. We still have two more trips to it but I think she'll be ready to be done when it closes. The basement had some water in it because I accidentally bumped the furnace's condensate line. So the foam squares that I have in the weight room are all up right now to let the floor dry. So when Lucy said she wanted to play with her foam squares, I gladdly added mine into the mix and we had some real big foam square fun. She also went sailing and riding roller coasters in a box on my legs. It was a fun night.
Outside of that I mostly worked on my journal. It is all printed. I'll do another proof reading tonight before I bind it to my current journal.
### September 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Windows being basically done. They just need to fill some holes in the trim.
2. Fun interesting new work for this cycle.
3. Cool evenings with open windows

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a critical eye.

Entry

Yesterday I apparently forgot to journal. Two days ago I started work in earnest on the postman GHA and learned a lot of what not to do. At the end of the day decided to use a docker action instead of a node one. After work, I forget what I did. I had some time but not a lot and then we had supper and I took Lucy to our penultimate trip to the pool. After I got home I fiddled with Halo on Megan's computer and mine testing to see if I could perhaps get a local round of Halo going. I did succeed at that. I think flipping on "use relays" also helped, though I don't know if such is the case with the LAN attempt. Regardless. It worked locally and then it worked when I played with Ben later. :success: at last we can play the Halo Campaigns together. 
The next day at work I mostly hammered on postman in docker GHA. Got it working. Was pleased. Trying to refine it now. My mom was here yesterday after Gamelan so after work was mostly relaxing and chatting. It was some good conversation. After my mom departed we prepared supper and played video games. Made a little progress on TotK. Spent most of our time underground until we realized we had run out of arrows! For the first time since we started playing. It was a shock. So Megan did some house keeping in the latter half of her time. 
### September 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Safe travels to and from the weekend event
2. No sunburns. :success:
3. Excitement over a new quarter coming.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a lovely family that is great to hang out with.

Entry

Friday I hacked on the Postman GHA for most of the day. Nothing else of note to report. After work Lucy and I went to the pool. The intention was to stay the whole time, but Lucy had her fill by 6:30 and we headed home. It's good to know she has had enough pool for the year. Got home and most of the focus was on getting ready to go for the weekend.
The next morning we got up at 6:30 and were on the road by 7:10. Not to shabby! Unfortunately we missed a turn on the way there and added about 40 minutes, it happens. We got there around 1. We played at the beach after having lunch and Lucy got to experience a life jacket for the first time in her memory. She was stoked by this discovery. She could float by herself! Hopefully this will motivate her to learn to swim next year to do swim lessons so that she can go out in the deep water on her own without the life jacket. In the evening we relaxed and sat around a camp fire.
The next morning we went to a play ground and then had some lunch at a pavilion there. We went to the small in door water park in the afternoon. It actually wasn't a half bad place. It favored the little ones, but I think I'd prefer that honestly. We hung around in the evening after supper. We snuck up onto the roof of one of the cabins to recover a pair of bean bags just for the fun of it. 
Megan's Uncle's families are such different people from her father. The middle brother, Casey (I think?), and his family tend to be reclusive and don't engage much with the rest of us. They typically were off doing something on their own. Including meals I think at times. Like, why even come? And then there is Aaron and Jessica and their little ones Jacob and Issac. Lucy is in between the two of them, but is notably younger than Jacob by about 3 years. But never the less the two of them got along pretty well. That was good. But I feel like the parenting style of Aaron and Jess could not be more different than my and Megan's sometimes. They have such an authoritarian "Do as I say" attitude most of the time and would bark orders at the little ones. The moment that crystalized it for me was when they were nearly ready to head out, but there was still some play in the joints, Jacob asked if he could tell a story with his already rolled story dice. An activity that takes maybe 60 seconds. Aaron walked out and declared they were going and tough luck kid. I understand the mind set of "you should have done it when you had the chance." certainly I tell that to Lucy at times. But seriously? I don't think Aaron even knew what the story dice were so he probably couldn't have made an informed decision. But it just struck me so much as a "you're input does not matter. I'm the only one who matters here. Deal with it." I was not impressed. 
It clearly is having an impact on their kids to. It was fairly clear that Jacob's life vest was not on right. After he took it off and I could see the sizing info it was clear it was a size to big. But even before that I looked at it and said "Jacob, your life vest is on wrong." And he sharply retorted "NO, it's on right." I insisted and the more insistent I was the more he dug in his heels so I backed off, there was no point. Later Jacob was trying to play video games and I was trying to give him advice and he was ignoring me, I think actively ignoring me. I just gave up. I wasn't going to waste my breath. The attitude that Aaron and Jess are instilling into their children is not a good one. And I realize that any attempts to suggest such will just result in Aaron and Jess being defensive and making a poor opinion of me in the process. So I guess it's whatever. I will leave them to their own devices.
Anyway, yesterday morning we packed up before we went over to breakfast so that we could head out. After a while we headed back to the beach for a while. I made a sand castle, this time a water mill with a reservoir whose base I eventually dug out and let the water run down the sluice. It was cute. Then we headed back to the pavilion from the previous day and had lunch before heading home. I played some Tears while finishing my audio book and then we swapped and I mostly thought about AI for the remainder of the trip. We got home and unpacked pretty quick since it was a fairly short trip. Started figuring out the things that need to be done as we are at the beginning of a new month and a new quarter and home from a trip. Quite the combo. It will be a busy week.
Last note. I think either I have pushed Hannah to far or she has changed her opinion of physical touch. I feel like it's the latter. And I can tell that's what my feelings tell me to. She was not responding well to any playful contact. Either confused or "can you please not" she said at one point. So. I shant. She is now in the same category as Amanda. Some one who I'm not afraid to touch, but for whom contact that doesn't have a specific purpose, like a hand up, is not beneficial and potentially detrimental. So. No more touchy. 
### September 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Cool weather. It is nice out. 
2. A productive evening.
3. Progress at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does a good job at parenting Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday I worked with Justin to verify that the approach of having fluent bit do the redacting would in fact not work. After that I got distracted by trying to have ChatGPT figure out if a freezer was experiencing issues or not by giving it sensor readings and nothing else. It is an interesting idea, but one that still need work. After that I got myself unstuck on a code issue, felt good about that, and hammered away at another one after Justin got me un-stuck.
After work I immediately played with Lucy since she asked to play with foam squares again last night. My foam squares were still up off the floor after the condensate issue. After Papa time and supper I went down stairs and cleaned the basement floor. Or at least the part in the weight room area. After just the floor my water was very dirty. I tried cleaning a foam square with it and quickly realized I would be getting the squares MORE dirty that way so I changed my water. I had to leave all of that to dry afterwards so I worked on other things as well. 
Got the curtains up in the upstairs bathroom so that we could remove the towel Megan jammed into the window as a temporary solution. Then I got Lucy's blind up. I wanted to get the last on up in our room but I was short the wall anchors I needed. I found a quick model online and tried to print them but was having no luck. For some reason my printer was just hanging after it got extruder heated and was not printing. So I didn't end up getting to that last night. But while I waited I worked on the budget. It was a pretty busy evening all in all but I'm starting to feel things come into place as I pick up steam for this quarter. 
### September 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D printer (printed some wall anchors)
2. A productive garden
3. Co-op campaign working smoothly now with Ben.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a lot of fun to make out with.

Entry

Yesterday I just hacked away the client api migration to the new chassis. It was long and tiring but I got to the end of it by the end of the day. 
After work I did not have time for exercise since it was a cubbies night. We made supper quick and Megan took Lucy to cubbies. I did some tiddying up around the house till she got home and then we had some time our selves. After such I continued efforts and getting all the windows in order and such. I then went out to pick tomatoes from our tomato thicket. I'll need to research how to string up tomato plants for next year. In about 20 minutes of picking I collected 10 lbs of tomatoes. And I think I'm through about a 3rd of the plants. I'll have a lot more tomatoes to pick. I spent then about 10 minutes processing the tomatoes with imperfections. Finally sat down to play halo with Ben. We got through missions 4 and 5 of reach. 
### September 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 30 lbs of tomatoes
2. Lovely weather, including the light rain
3. Completed the PR for getting client API migrated to the new chassis at last.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is enjoying her bike more these days.

Entry

Yesterday I finally finished up preping the Client API migration to the new chassis pull request. That was a doozy. I'm sure I'll still have more work to do on it, but that will wait till after PQA. 
After work I had thought about doing salsa as Ultimate was cancelled due to no body being in town, but Megan didn't want to much traffic in the kitchen so I just shredded some zucchini and went out to gather more tomatoes. We had supper and Lucy was then going to ride her little car but it is having battery issues and wouldn't turn on. It was very sad. So I finished the tomato harvest and we went on a bike ride instead. After the bike ride we played some Tears, working our way to get the last of the great fairies and a couple more unlocks like the last of the gliding clothing. We have a lot more to do in the game I think, but we can only tackle so much of the depths at a time. 
### September 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Stored up food from our garden
2. Some lovely rain
3. A good DnD session

Thing I love about Megan: 
I happy with my work

Entry

Fixed up some PRs and started work on the documentation script. It was a pretty good day.
After work we went to ribs and rods. Apparently Friday is not a good day to go to Ribs and Rods. There was only 3-4 bbq places and no hot rods. To next year we told my dad to come on a Saturday for the real experience. In other news I drank my self silly with Wild Bill's Soda. I wasn't feeling so great trying to sleep that night. Which, speaking of sleep, there was a pretty funny run of events in the middle of the night. About midnightish I think Lucy started crying speratically. I expected her to come to our bed but she didn't and after a minute I went to her. I picked her up and she wiggled around until she settled down with her feet on the pillow and head on my lap. I stroked her head still she fell asleep and put her back down, sitting for another minute after she was tucked in to be sure. Megan had no relocation of this in the morning. But the funny part is at about 4 Lucy came to our bed and I had no memory of that. So we both took care of Lucy with the other sleeping through it. I find it quite amusing.
Saturday was pretty good. I tried to get my printer going in the morning to print a static orb for Devin with Cat ears but I was having no luck. I got pretty frustrated with that printer at that point not doing what I want it to do. But, that aside, the DnD session was great, and didn't actually involve any combat. I managed to actually bluff my way through an encounter and it kept us on good terms with some people. Huzzah for an idiot bluff. After DnD the project I wanted to accomplish for the day was clearing out TrunkTrunk. And I finally did it. I trashed most of the stuff but a lot of it I still need to go through and so it is now sitting on my desk. I took the lid off of TrunkTrunk and it has begun it's second life as wood storage with it's new caster wheels. 
Sunday was pretty relaxing and fun. We went to church and there was a 0.71" of rain during such. Then we went to a BBQ with friends and played some card games. We then came home and did a bunch of work in the kitchen. I cleaned, made another batch of crushed tomatoes, and prepared the crock pot with tomato paste. Megan made Lasagna. While it cooked and after we played Zelda. It was a nice day.
### September 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A safe country
2. A healthy garden
3. A lovely family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Might be pregnant, who knows?

Entry

Yesterday I worked on my documentation update reminder script mostly.
After work I did my first run of the season. Felt pretty good, Did the 3.1m track in 31 minutes. I'll be aiming to push that down in the future. I want to try to get to 9 minute miles which means I need to drop about 3 minutes off that time. This will be my push for this quarter.
After that I did various things around the house, but mostly worked on some modeling. I specifically wanted to do some test prints of the bike trailer hook I'm designing to hold Lucy's bike while we are on a bike ride. I've managed to find a work around to get things to print promptly with my printer. I set the temperature to high and it accepts it as ready straight away. Not the greatest but it is something I can do remotely and seems to be working. I need to dig in a little deeper as to what might be causing it. I got a test of the clamp printed and ensured fitting, but due to probing failures did not get the first full hook to print last night. This morning I did and I made some tweaks and am printing another one now. Additionally we worked on the garden a bunch last night. Mostly clearing out weeds. They kind of took over everything. 
### September 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My little Lucy
2. Successful printing from thought to completion
3. Flexible work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages me

Entry

Worked on client api and documentation reminding yesterday. Was a pretty good day. 
After work I did my core exercises. Some what annoyingly Lucy decided to join me during such, but I maintained a positive attitude and was not annoyed by the end of it. After that we played hide and seek and with her foam squares. It was a good papa time. Then we had supper. All the while I also had printed and fitted some hooks onto the bike trailer to hold Lucy's bike while we rode. The design worked great and with some zip ties to hold them tight they were rock solid the whole time. I was able to throw her back on the rack one handed in a 2-3 seconds. Perfection. So we took a bike ride after supper. It was pretty dark by that point so Lucy had to ride in the trailer for most of it which didn't make her happy. I don't blame her. Next time we'll aim for an earlier bike ride so she can bike more and we can make the most of the easy on easy off bike rack. After that I spent some time fiddling in scad on my next project. Went to bed.
### September 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My 3D prints coming together nicely
2. Halo co-op finally working between me and Ben.
3. Motivation to push on my exercising

Thing I love about Megan: 
Handles a lot of produce

Entry

Yesterday wasn't amazing. I feel like it was scattered a bit. And then my VPN went down for a while, but I made progress on crisper, so that's good.
After work I ran. I had pulled off 31 minutes to do my 3.05 mile track on Monday so I was expecting to push myself to be able to hit even that time. But to my surprise I actually managed 30 minutes. If I can keep pressing like that I'll make 27 minutes in no time! Haha. But still. It is encouraging and I had to push through my tiredness so I'm happy to see my self motivation getting exercised too. After that I mostly worked on 3D model brackets for my server rack. I'm getting close to what I want with that. I hope to be able to cross off that particular task from my bullet journal soon! And then ended the evening playing through I think 3 Halo Reach missions. I have a hard time hearing some times what is being said, but otherwise I am enjoying it. 
### September 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Rain. So nice and relaxing
2. Window covering getting done and our house inching more into order.
3. A happy little Lucy.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is quite clever.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on crisper mostly. That project is coming to a good first pass. Waiting for some review on it now. After work it was decided to not do Ultimate due to lack of players. So I focused on putting up blinds, got the 3 new ones that were left up. Put up the curtain in the main floor bath. This allowed me to clear all the tools out of our bedroom to bring that room into order. I also worked some on 3D modeling, specifically for the back half of the server rack. I've encountered a snag as I'm not sure how to efficiently print the rack. I may need to go to the hardware store and pick up some metric screws and play with the idea of assembling pieces after they have been printed. Ended the day with some Tears of the Kingdom. We beat a Gleeok yesterday for the first time. It's not hard, just takes quite a few arrows and you've got to run from giant fireballs of doooooooooom.
### September 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A Saturday home to get some things done.
2. A fun day with Lucy, and the patience and willingness to let it happen.
3. A good bike ride to and from church.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Decided my crazy plan to bike to church wasn't toooo crazy.

Entry

Friday I got distracted mostly by trying to kick the client api merger out the door. It was annoying. And then I tried various dead ends for API based data extraction form Github. None got me what I needed with a reasonable number of calls. After work we went and did frisbee golf. After that I spent the evening working on a design for my server rack. But I ran out of time to get it printed before bed.
Saturday morning I started the print straight away, right from bed infact actually. The test print was done by the time we were done with breakfast. It fit well so the next phase of things was to print the full size version. And for that I needed to add the tweak of hexagonal holes to the screws for m3 bolts. For that I needed to go to the hardware store to get some said bolts. And thus began one of the more notable parts of my day. I biked to the hardware store and brought Lucy along with me. She biked on her own to main street and then rode in the trailer to the store. While we were biking to the store I noticed a bare foundation where a house had been and that had been moved. I decided that one the way home we would stop there, and so we did. I pointed out parts of the foundation and Lucy noticed the house in the distance up on blocks. It was a good little stop. I am trying to do unusual things and let these little moments filter into Lucy's life, and for that matter my own. I tend to be more of a destination than the journey sort of guy. So this was a bit of a stretch for me. But I was not disappointed.
Got home, added bolt holes to the rack trees and got the first one to start printing. By then it was lunch time. (the bike ride took QUITE a while with Lucy. But that's ok. ^ _ ^ ) Took a nap and then started working on the garage. I wanted to fill the crack in the garage floor. That ended up taking way more caulk than expected. Could have saved my self 5 bucks by buying all 3 tubes, or really 4, in one go. Oh well. Live and learn. I also accomplished all the tear down and clean up of Urbosa's door. I really need to have that project completed before winter so we can have the garage sealed up good. My work on that went overall well. I was missing not having a chop saw, table saw, or band saw, but I made it work with what I had, and I still have all my fingers and toes. After an afternoon of working on that I cleaned up and mowed the lawn. We went on a walk at mulberry bend and so continued having an interesting day for Lucy and myself.
Concluded the evening with doing some trimming on the cursed flower bed to pull out the trees growing there. Supper was running late so I showered before supper. And then did the little chores I forget: Watering plants, changing batteries, etc. My print was 99% done when the automatic timed shut off of the printer occurred. I restarted it and it took all of 4 minutes to complete. Glad I noticed.
The next morning Megan had agreed to my some what crazy idea of going to church via a bike ride. We managed to make it in about 19 minutes. Not bad. It was a tad chilly though. We'll be boxed out of this idea by the morning chill I think before anything else. 
The sermon was a start of a series on Ephesians. I'm looking forward to this book. Partly because of some things I've been struggling through personally recently. Since at least January I've been having existential dread over whether or not I am right in my faith. And I can reason it well. Rationally I believe I have made the correct decision. But I fear in my heart I don't believe it. How can one measure one's heart? And more so. While I may say I am ready and willing to die if the Lord calls me to, I still cling to life. Is that sinful? Am I putting my life before God? I had a night where I couldn't fall asleep this was troubling me again to no end. I remember even having a dream where I was screaming at God "This is to hard!" but by his grace, I have received a theophany. While it is right that I say I am ready to die and if God calls me to, same for all of my family members. But I do not feel called to such. Further more, God has called me to be the steward of this life he has given me. And so, I shall live, I shall strive to make the most of this life I can and live as long as I can until I feel God calling me home. I need not worry, it will come when it comes, but I will always keep myself in a ready state. 
After church I biked home. Fiddled with my finally finished server rack, and then fiddled with Megan's bike chain since we had forgotten the code. I eventually hacked it and got the chain to open, by that point, about 40 minutes of effort latter, it was time to head back to church. So I did. Picked up Megan and we headed off to Mr. Smith's for lunch. Not sure if we'll do that again, it was a very long wait. Mostly for sandwiches, which is what Megan ordered. Lucy and I had received our food and finished eating and Megan still had not gotten her sandwich. And then when she finally did she found it rather disappointing. 
After we got home, Ultimate was cancelled again due to lack of people. So we played tears. Made some more little progress here and there. Then I worked on some things in the kitchen, we had a bonfire, and it was bed time. It was a good day.
### September 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Great progress on my personal website
2. Hope and a future
3. Patience

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Yesterday was not what I wanted. Client API's chassis migration is getting me down.
After work I ran, managed to pull off 30:30 in terms of time, right between my last two times. Hopefully this means I can get 29:30 tomorrow right? ^^; Other than that I spent most of my evening working on my personal website. Since I decided to go back to using flask, and specifically in this case, frozen flask, I have made great progress. The realization of I just need something simple certainly helped it along. I hope to get it all finished tonight.
### September 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My personal website up and running again.
2. Fun in the mud pit
3. Hydocorisone

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is productive.

Entry

Yesterday I tried to get the client api chassis migration out the door and it flopped. So I'm putting it off at least till next week. Focused instead on the creature comforts for Postman. Got stuck and gave up. Then tried again and am starting to see my problem. This isn't the first time I've had this issue. And it really boils down to not taking the time to fully understand what was happening. If I understood what each step was doing I would have realized sooner I was sending the wrong commitish to the create commit status command. Now my objective is to find the correct commitish.
After work I did my exercise. It was tough but that is the point. Lucy has taken to sitting with me during my exercise which I admittedly am not wild about, but it harmless. She'll get bored of it eventually. After that it was Papa time! We had decided to do the mud pit. Which wasn't available during large parts of the summer due to overgrowth. And we used the mud kitchen as it was meant to be used at long last. It was fun, Lucy got dirty, though she was not enamored by it. We showed to get the mud off of us and our swimsuits while Megan made supper. After that I worked on my personal website. I finally got it to a condition that I can call it "up".
### September 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. More rain.
2. More progress on getting our home back in order
3. Only a small rash from the cursed flower bed this time.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took care of most of the work of ordering the blinds.

Entry

Yesterday I banged my head on the postman status stuff until I got it to work. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger eh? I think I'm no worse for the wear and I definitely have a better understanding of the working of GHA and such now.
After work I started working on extracting the remaining bleeding hearts and transplanting them. Didn't get that done before supper, but continued the process after and managed to complete it about the time Megan returned from dropping off Lucy for cubbies. We spent just about the entire time Lucy was at Cubbies discussing window treatments. Annoying that it took so long, but we now have a plan for ALL the windows on our main floor which I believe completes the process and gets us fully covered. 1.4k$ worth of window coverings, which is steep, but they are nice window coverings with nice features that should last. It is very nice to have that problem finally out of the way. After that I played Halo with Ben, we have I think just 1 real mission left in reach before we get to Halo:CE. Which I am stoked for. Finally we'll get to my stomping grounds. 
### September 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Some guidance on my toe nails
2. More Tomatoes... I think...
3. Lovely weather. Nice and cozy. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is great for conversation.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly worked on documentation for QA. It was a lot of time but I stand by the value of good documentation.
After work, since it had been raining all day, ultimate frisbee was cancelled so I went for a run instead since cubbies kept me from doing such yesterday. 28:46. My fastest time yet. And that's just what my phone recorded, technically it is basically always 15-20 seconds faster than what my phone records due to the 15 seconds I spend after I finish running counting and calculating my heart rate. (pushed it clear up to 168 yesterday.) My phone tells me I'm at 9:25min/mile. Not to shabby considering I started at 10:08. I'm feeling hopeful about hitting 9:00 before it gets to cold.
After running I tried cooling off for a bit, but kept getting pulled away from my fan. Eventually I was cool enough and Lucy was grumpy enough that I sat on the sofa and watched a video with her. Then we had supper. Then I went out and picked two more buckets full of tomatoes. I processed the ones that were bad into chucks and stowed those in the fridge. I'll process through them this weekend. I think I'll be doing one more batch of crushed tomatoes. That will give us 24 jars overall. That should be plenty to last us the entire year. Any more after this will go into tomato paste. That paste can always be turned into other good stuff. I've though also about making BBQ sauce but for the most part that would basically just mean take a jar of crushed tomatoes and/or some blocks of tomato paste and spices. That is something that I can easily do during the winter. 
After that work was done we sat down to play some TotK trying to find Yiga bases. We are so far getting throughly stumped. We have a map in the one Yiga base suggesting where the other bases might be, but we have not had any luck finding them. Frustrating. 
### September 26

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hope for another child
2. A good trip to Orange City
3. Progress on my quarterly goals.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is fearless some times.

Entry

Took yesterday off so didn't get any journaling done then. So Friday. At work I mostly finished up the documentation reminders GHA. It will be distributed out to the other teams soon. After work we went and played disc even though it was threatening to rain. We got rained on a little as we were departing but that turned out to be it. After we got back and had supper, I don't remember what I did in the evening.
Saturday morning comes. I slept in since I was making muffins instead of bread. We sat and enjoyed our muffins and Jordan Peterson on the front porch while it was pouring. It was quite enjoyable. And it had finished raining by the time we were done. Shortly after that I got ready and departed for DnD. It was a good session though I need to figure out how to work with our team's mage. Devon's static orb is a great AoE but it basically blocks off my ability to do anything since it hits friendlies.
After DnD I came back and worked in the garage a bit. I also canned 5 more cans of tomatoes. Yes, 5 cans. Cause I miss estimated and came short. Blast. Next time I'll try to miss estimate the other direction. But we have a total of 23 cans of crushed tomatoes now so I think we are done canning such for the year. From this point on it is all going into tomato paste. I got my new garage door footer's cut and screwed together. Now I just need to install them. Garage door task making small but regular progress. I just need it done before it gets to cold to paint, which now that I realize that's the constraint not the snow, that's coming a lot sooner than I expected. eep!
In the evening after supper and shower I worked on rewriting Thor. To my delight I was able to break it out and get it back to working order inside of one night. The next day we went to church, and as I was not on sound, I returned home early via bike. I then threw myself back into the Thor refinements. I got a web server up and running and figured out how to pass the relays and sensors up to said web page. It took me all morning and afternoon, but I got it to the point where it was a useful debug tool and used it to figure out what was going on with the back yard light and front porch light having cross talk issues. (The little indicator lights seem to be the crux of the issue) It felt really good having such clear vision into that system at long last.
After that was normal Sunday evening cleaning and prep work. We started having a bon fire but it was cut short by Megan needing to go comfort Amanda who had been physically assaulted that morning. She was, understandably, a bit shaken. So Lucy and I put out the fire and retreated inside to play some Zelda.
Monday rolls around and it is time for me to tackle my next refinement task. This time it's my SDR script. Though the approach I am using is the same basic idea, break it into separate parts that are easy to understand and provide insight into the system via a web browser. I made some progress before we departed for Orange City. The doctor's appointment went well, we have some indication on what to do next and hope to have some answers from that in the next few months if not a baby. Here's hoping this cycle will be the one. After the appointment we hung out at my mom's. Took Lucy to a play ground and she and I played with some other kids there. Came back and had some supper and then headed home to call it a night.
### September 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Garage door project coming along
2. My health being pretty good, hopefully it stays that way till after the ent moot.
3. A good nights sleep.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can make babies!

Entry

Mostly read up on Grafana Loki yesterday during work. After work I tried to exercise but I seem to have wounded my shoulder playing with kids on Monday, so I'm taking it easy. After that then I went off to Lulu time with Lucy. We went to the park with the blue slides which we haven't been to since at least spring if not last year. She clearly had forgotten some aspects of it. But notably she was willing to give some things a try, like at least climbing the lowest levels of the rock walls. Very good. We came back and had supper. I realized yesterday that my garage door efforts need to be completed not before the snow flies but before the frost comes as I need to paint in weather that is above 50 degrees. We still have plenty of those left to be fair, but once they are here they are here and there is naught that I can do about it, so I focused on the garage door yesterday. I think I'm actually to the point now where I can start putting up some paint maybe even tonight. It was a very successful effort last night. 
### September 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. The house continuing to come together after a summer of disarray from the windows.
2. Lovely cool weather
3. Not sick yet. Hopefully I stay that way.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is sympathetic to my concerns about getting sick just before the entmoot.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly just read up on Loki. I got the cluster in the afternoon and spent some time kicking tires. Haven't gotten it to work yet.
After work I ran. Managed 8:59 min/mile overall. Success! I managed to achieve 9 minute miles over 3 miles. I'm not going to run again now until October 9th so I'm not going to change anything for now. But it is nice seeing my time push down on my chart. After that I started working on curtains. I got the big window's holder in place, though we may move them, and got the one at the bottom of the stairs up. I was supposed to put up curtain rods in Lucy's room but we couldn't for the lives of us find the darn things. We knew we had them on Saturday but were at a complete loss as to where they got. I eventually found them when I was checking on Lucy just before we went to bed. They were on top of her wall mounted bookshelf. Clearly, my fault. After I got as many curtains as I could it was game time with Ben. We finished up Reach and started Halo:CE. I'm excited to be back in my old stomping grounds. The halo I know and love. We played "Pillar of Autumn" on legendary. Though we are not likely to do so for the rest of the missions. The Original Halo missions could be so long.
### September 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 110lbs of produce from our garden so far (all tomatoes, potatoes, and pumpkins)
2. Excitement for the coming Entmoot.
3. A happy Lulu

Thing I love about Megan: 
A gracious woman.

Entry

Yesterday I stumbled my way through things mostly, but at the end of the day I still was not where I needed to be. Hopefully today I can get it to work.
After work I dug up potatoes. Ultimate was cancelled for the season due to lack of people. Hopefully we'll have a new exercise thing soon. I also stirred the compost pile a little which made me thing again that I should find a more permanent solution for a compost pile. Then we played video games. We finally found the Yiga bases. One we had to look up a hint for. But we finally did it. And we infiltrated the main Yiga base as a result. Huzzah! Next time we play I'm going to push down into the cavern under Hyrule castle. I'm guessing that's where we need to go next and hopefully ultimately. 
### October 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Getting to the airport fine
2. A productive weekend
3. Heading out to an entmoot

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes great care of me. 

Entry

Friday I ground my gears mostly. Didn't make a lot of progress as I kept finding reasons the cluster was not yet configured correctly. Hopefully I'll be able to do something with it very shortly after the ent moot.
After work my focus was once again on the garage doors. I wanted to get them wholy ready to be painted when I return so it was wood epoxy day. I cleaned the door a bit and then started smearing wood epoxy all over the little bumps and nicks in the door as well as filling in the LARGE gap I left when I put in the replacement bits on the south side of the north door, not my best work. I hope and suspect my attempts on the south door will be much better. Then it was time for a family bike ride, and quite probably the final trip to the ice cream store for the year. Got home and I poked around at the garage where the stray wires come into the garage for a bit to try and ascertain how I might route wires from there up into the attic to control the sconces in the garage. Succeeded at my experiments and it left me hopeful for the next day.
Saturday was a busy day. Made pumpkin scones in the morning and then went right away to work where I left off on the garage sconces. I went to the hardware store to pick up a few things I needed and then I came back and worked for a little while. I didn't bring Lucy with me this time because she was playing happily at home and I didn't want to break that. I returned to the hardware store with a little more specifics on what I needed and came home. I worked till about 2 on the sconces and was very pleased with the results I managed. I didn't end up needing the 50ft of cable so I returned that and got 25ft. I properly put all the connections into gang boxes and put wire reliefs everywhere I was supposed to. Everything should be up to code. By the time I was done the garage sconces were in the lighting system! I was very pleased. This is one of the first major efforts I have made that will stay with the house and continue to be useful. Huzzah! I also cleaned up the garage doors and sanded the wood epoxy so it is all ready for paint this Saturday.
Sunday was the beginning of the anxiety. I could feel it already by the time I got to church early in the morning. I couldn't focus through the sermon. I was also feeling very sleepy. We got home and I took my afternoon nap and cuddled Megan for a bit. Then got mostly packed and headed down stairs to play some video games for a while. Cleaned the kitchen, made supper, had a bon fire. I wore my clothes to bed which informed me that picking a sleeping shirt is a very careful thing. The shirt I'm wearing right now is slightly itchy and I bothered me enough that I took it off in the middle of the night. Amanda arrived at 3:25, a bit early, and whisked me away to the air port. in the 12th hour Megan's comments about closed toed shoes spooked me and I tried to shove mine in, but I wasn't satisfied with any of the attempts and just decided to leave them. There was no comment about them last year, but last year I was sick and missed high calibre. I certainly hope to not be sick this year but if I do need closed toed shoes I bet I could find some one whom I could borrow them from. Here's hoping the rest of my travel goes well, it's 9:40 and my next flight departs at 13:15 so I've got 3 more hours to burn.
Addendum: The ride with Amanda was quiet most of the way. We didn't really talk except for a bit at the beginning and the end. I am kind of sad at this missed opportunity to chat with my sister in law. But I guess I was tired and she wasn't feeling very talkative so no talking occurred. 
### October 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good Entmoot
2. Health through the whole of the Entmoot
3. Successfully waking up on time for the flights at both ends of the trip.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has managed without me for the week I am gone.

Entry

This week was the entmoot. Picking up where I left off on Monday's entry. I sat in the upper area of the Rotunda for a couple of hours and worked on my habitica integration for my personal tasks. I got it into a much better condition. I have noticed a notably more object orient shift in my programming styling since I've been reading design patterns and since I read "clean architecture". This latest script again echos some of that. Anyway. After some recreational programming I had lunch and made my way to my plane. Ran into Jaron and Bryce at the gate, so those two were my first, and as it happens last, contact this year. Plane ride was pretty short and the drive was relatively uneventful. The road my BnB was on was under construction which threw me for a bit of a loop while I was trying to get to it, but I eventually found my way there. As a side note, not having the google maps app and only the google maps website is a problem when ever I need to navigate by myself.
After I dropped my stuff I swung by base for a bit and then headed out to Justin's house. Mark was already there so we sat around and chatted. Drake showed up, Then Emily. We had supper. Then Cheryl desided to crash the party and brought Zach with her. Eventually Todd arrived as well. We played a VR game and then some board games. It was a little late by the time I got back to my BnB and I was exhausted by that time and so went to bed rather promptly. 
The next day was pretty good. We had a group activity building spaghetti structures to hold up a marsh mellow. Then we had team time. We got through a lot of discussion as Delta this week. It was good. Monday evening comes and several of the Locals were asking if we had any plans. Myself, Emily, Trent, and one or two others were basically of the opinion of "If I don't do something here, I'll sit by myself in my BnB. So lets play games or something." and so we did. I got to bed a little earlier the second night trying to save strength for high caliber. 
Wednesday we had a trip to a corn maze and then had lunch as a team. We discussed a bit of things along the way. We got back and there was a meeting with Sean and Raoul about DevOps at CE that I sat in on but to no benefit. I conked out through the whole thing, but that was good because then I could stay away during the next meeting. We are reading "The ideal team player" as a tech team over the remainder of this year. I've got to have 33 pages read by next Friday. Shouldn't be to hard. We had some Delta discussion about the book. Then we prepared to do some catapulting. We were going to do it Thursday morning but the weather looked like it would rain so we switched to Wednesday evening instead. It was a fun activity but the intern did manage to gash his head on the first pull of the evening. We didn't have any further injuries the rest of the evening and the teams managed to get some pretty impressive throws. Our first attempts were struggling to get 40-60 feet but by the end we could get 180 feet on luck shots. It was indeed quite an entertaining event. After that it was board game night. One team went out to eat pizza, and they ordered 5 to go and brought them back for the rest of us. We played some Secret hitler and then got to our epic game of Fish Bowl. We had 7 rounds: Taboo, Charades, Password, Sound Effects, Puppet, Pictionary, and Ghost. Perhaps we'll come up with another one for next year. It was probably the highlight of the week for me. We proceeded to play Ouisi at Cheryl's behest and boy did she rub us the wrong way with it. The problem is even if we aren't competitive, we all still programmers and opperate best with clear rules and objectives. Cheryl's rule of "Make mom smile" did not set well with us at all and when we brought in Mike Miller to the judge as we kept calling the role, to Cheryl's great dismay, we managed to get something going that kept us entertained enough. But eventually we concluded that game and played throw throw borito to conclude the evening. 
Thursday was more team time in the morning. Met with Sean and Raoul to continue the discussion about DevOps. Delta is over all of the opinion that they are a bit to ambitious. We then ran through the rain to Emily's car, since she had a sports car, and zipped off to High Caliber. I was so happy this year to be health for the event. Though I will say Archery tag was no where near as exciting as I hoped it would be. Never the less, the go karts were great! Overall a lot of fun was had but I'm not going to be a vocal advocate for High Caliber next year. Oh, I also did some Axe throwing and apparently have a natural nack for it. After High Caliber we went to Todd's for supper and games. Played Flying Goblins, Dominion, and Secret Hitler. It was fun, had a little discussion about Sean's proposals before heading home. Early flight the next morning so I wanted to get to bed before it was to late.
Every night of the week I video chatted with Megan and Lucy. It was nice to see them daily and hear Lucy's voice. I do miss them a bit and will be happy to get back home to them. Though I was pleased that I was actually able to get to hug my team mates this year since I wasn't sick as a dog. I had a really good time with Emily and Justin in particular. They felt like a brother and little sister by the end of it.
Got up in time for my first flight just fine this morning. Got to the airport without issue and am now back in the mezanine of the rotunda waiting for my flight. 9:30 now, I have until 15:15 to burn. Hopefully the flight won't get delayed. Right now the long wait is tolerable because I know when it will end. Last year the several hour delay was rough since I had no idea when it would end.
### October 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Safe travels back.
2. A productive weekend.
3. Warm cozy bed. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is quite the sexy woman.

Entry

The rest of my travels went well. When I landed in Siouxfalls I had the convenience of Home Assistant to watch Megan's approach so I knew when she was about to arrive at the airport. That was very useful. Hopefully after I flash my phone's OS it's location issues will evaporate and I'll be able to go back to having useful location information in home assistant. Anyway, we had supper and Denny's and I lementated over the fact that I probably gained a few pounds on this trip (yup, about 6) and will need to put some effort into working them off. I know I'm skinny. But I'd like to remain that way. It will be a lot easier to work myself back to 200lbs from 209 than 250 or 300. We relaxed for the most part that evening as we were all spent.
Saturday we got up promptly to eat breakfast and get out the door for the D-Days parade/candy replenishment event. Lucy's candy is mostly what get replenished during this event, but Megan and I draw from her candy as well so it serves us well for a fully year typically. Pretty easily so when you add in Halloween as well. After that we returned home and I did something inside, including a nap, until the afternoon when things had warmed up a bit. Then it was off to the races on the garage door frames. I clean, sanded, painted, repeat. Trying to get the frames ready so I can start finishing them ASAP. I also got the vertical trim pieces cut to size and then did some cleaning up in the garage. Trying to get all my tasks in for the day. I also did some cleaning on my desk. Most notably I made a little USB extension that allows me to drop the voltage component from a USB cord so I can have the Octopi connected to the 3D printer without the printer trying to draw power from the pi, thus making power cycling the printer possible without having to unplug the pi. 
Sunday we went to church. I was still feeling the exhaustion from the trip but managed to stay mostly awake through the sermon. After that I came home, cut Tomatoes, and just kinda crashed. Went and picked Megan and Lucy up. Came back, had lunch, went up stairs to take a rest, had some good intimate time with Megan, and then started working on the garage door frame again. I got the trim up! So I am inching closer and closer. I sincerely hope to be done with this project by the end of this week. I hope also to get some painting done in the garage after that. Paint over the patches on the wall I made when I rewired the porch lights and outlets. I was pretty tired by the end of that and then I cleaned the kitchen, and then I made supper, and then we went on a bike ride (for our last trip to cow and spoon of the year). All in all when Megan proposed sitting on the sofa and playing Zelda at the end of the evening last night, I didn't have a strong argument against it. I was tired.
### October 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Garage door project coming to a completion.
2. A decent night's sleep despite my ankle.
3. A safe home

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has been excited by seed saving as I have been this year.

Entry

Apparently I forgot to write in my journal yesterday. So, Monday. Hammered on some loki trying to get logs to flow from preview. Got it working by the end of the day.
After work I ran. Then we had supper. Then I worked on the garage door, trying to get it all handled before it got to dark. I was racing against the clock on that one. I had the garage sconces on and my battery powered light out trying to keep my work area well light enough to finish work for the day and I was done at 7:30. I then cleaned up and headed inside. My phone has been on the fritz with it's location data for a little while now, a couple weeks. Between that and a couple other things I bit the bullet and went back to stock Android with all of it's googley implications. I'll survive. But I did walk away from this with a couple important pieces of information: Before I can go google free in earnest I need a good replacement for google maps and I need Megan to be on board with switching to proton calendar. Those were two major pain points that I had trouble getting around. Anyway, I was not able to get my phone flashed before it was time for bed as I wanted to take care with this process.
The next day I worked on Loki more. I was waiting for Ops at one point so I flashed my phone mid-morning while Megan was gone. Risky, but I managed to get CE back on to me flashed device and didn't look at any porn. :success: I was of course throughly distracted most of the rest of the day as I was setting up my phone. But never the less I made great progress with Loki and have logs coming in from production now! Now I just need to be able to pull data out of the logs.
After work I painted the garage door first so I would have plenty of light. Then Lucy and I went and played at the park with the Blue Slides. about 2/3rds of the way through that evening I rolled my ankle and I convinced Lucy that we should go home and play some Mario Kart. I spent the rest of the evening with my leg propped up and at first with some ice. Megan commented at bed time when she saw the egg on the side of my leg "ok, that is pretty bad. I was wondering because I sprained my ankle just a few weeks ago and you seemed to be over reacting, but no, that's quite the egg" good to have external verification that I'm not over reacting.
### October 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Healing quickly
2. A lovely relaxing rainy day
3. A quicker budgeting process.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is my wife.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly hammered on Loki. Trying various things. Unfortunately I'm not confident in it enough to be able to say it is the correct choice. Unless I can assuage my concerns today and tomorrow I am going to recommend we try other things. 
After work we went to the fire station for the police and ems cook out. We got to see the fire trucks and ambulance and such. Lucy of course though was most entertained by coloring sheets, popcorn, and plastic ribbon she found on the ground. :eye roll:
After we got back I put another coat of paint on to the garage door. It's raining right now, but assuming things dry up between now and tonight I'll tape up the door and start working on the blue paint this evening. There is one spot that needs a third coat of pink, but I should be able to do that, wash the brush, and then do blue tonight. After that I did the budget, only took me an hour. Got a final number for our windows, 27k. Eye watering. I should crunch the numbers and see how much it cost us for material vs labor. 
Then Ben and I played Halo. Or at least tried to. He had to finish getting his new laptop setup and then we were having pretty bad lagging issues. Hopefully that can be sorted by next week.
### October 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lovely rainy days
2. A fixed down-a-vator
3. Tasty food

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves cuddles.

Entry

Yesterday I spoke ill of Loki. I'm not impressed by the performance. But the performance is so incredibly bad that I suspect we haven't configured it right. Will look into it a little more today.
After work no exercise, and the rain meant no painting. Soooooooo, I started work on fixing the rokenbok things. The down-a-vator was the simplest to fix, though thinking about it I should print some spare pins just in case. I then started working on one of the elevators that was not running at all. it seems like it has a power issue. But I ran out of time to fiddle with it last night. Because last night we finally did it! We beat Tears of the Kingdom. At least the main story line. The boss fight at the end was pretty great, and I pulled through by a hair. He kept destroying my shields, I was down to my last shield and 2 hearts when I got the finishing blow. Then we got to fight him as a dragon. Now of course the game is open ended for us. We don't have to stop playing, but now the game is about doing things we want rather than building up for the final boss. I'm batting for Final Fantasy 7 next.
### October 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 8 years of marriage.
2. A fun time in Sioux Falls.
3. Growing programming abilities.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Said yes to my proposal over 9 years ago now.

Entry

Friday I tried getting in as much Loki as I could before calling it quits. Even then by the end of the day I was without much of anything to do so I read my book. 
After work I hacked on Rokenbok. Trying to get everything repaired up before we head off to archer christmas in just a few weeks. I think I've got them mostly sorted but I'm going to bring a screw driver just in case.
Saturday was a bit of a busy morning. We had breakfast and then got ready to go at about 11:45ish for our anniversary day trip. We went up to Sioux Falls and did a food walking tour. Learned a little about Sioux Falls and ate things we would not likely order at a number of restaurants we would not likely go to. It was fun. We were going to do a corn maze after but it had been rainy the two days prior so they were closed due to wet grounds. We ended up just going to Perkins and having some desert before heading home. 
Sunday was pretty chill in comparison. I went to church early and ran sound. Megan, Lucy, and my Mom (who had been watching Lucy saturday) came to the second service. We all headed home had lunch, played some games, and then my Mom headed home. I played a little with Lucy, did some reading, played some Zelda, trying to get all of the light roots in the depths. I ended very close, just 1 light root left to get. Then I did my normal sunday kitchen time. We had supper and a bonfire. However all the wood was pretty wet so we were mostly getting smoked and called it early. While Megan bathed I circled back to my SDR refinements. Made some progress but not as much as I had hoped before bed time. Though the things I've learned from clean Architecture and clean code are certainly having an effect.
### October 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hopefully good signs of fertility
2. relative peace about the adoption process
3. Opportunity to help a friend

Thing I love about Megan: 
Brought me around on the idea of adoption some years ago now.

Entry

Monday I worked on my review video mostly. After work I did some painting. Not just the garage door but all around the house as I was painting with the blue paint I decided to touch up a number of places. Then I focused in on refining the SDR software after supper.
Tuesday was our day to go talk to the adoption lawyers. We also did a semen analysis just before so we are really hitting up all the avenues to get children. This latter came back very positive. Megan's fertility examine on Monday also came back mostly positive. Which puts us in a similar frustrating position as Kennan and Alaina "everything is fine, so why no baby?". The meeting with the adoption lawyers went well. They said we are a good couple, the kind they like working with. If all goes well we could have a placement within a year. That's kinda crazy! We chatted about it on the way home. There is something exciting about the possibility of having quasi twins if we happen to also conceive while pursuing adoption. I keep joke that fate is going to send us two pairs of twins if we continue this route. It would be crazy, but I'm all for it, bring it on fate!
After that we picked up the Jonker's kids as Hannah, who is expecting, was not feeling great. Grace and Ilisha had fun with Lucy all afternoon while I painted and chopped down our tomato plants. The last tomato harvest of the year. We are starting to wrap up everything in the garden. Just pumpkins and rhubarb left to tend to I believe. Unfortunately I also slightly broke my nice new little giant ladder. I think it is still usable, even in full extension mode, but I can't help feeling bad damaging something so nice. Anyway. Evening came. I processed the last harvest of tomatoes into tomato juice that is still concentrating in the crock pot. It was quite a full crock so it will probably still be going tomorrow. Then I finished up I think what I will do for the SDR refinements this quarter. I may circle back to it if I have more time, but right now I'm looking at the remaining two weeks of October and freaking out. 
### October 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A cozy nap
2. Fun getting to relive halo with Ben
3. Fall coming and the gardening season drawing to a close.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes cozy naps.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on a number of things. It's cool down.
After work I wanted to paint the garage but it rained. So hopefully I can get to the final coat this evening. It should be glorious weather. And then I can finally mark this project as complete. But lacking that option I played a little with Lucy and helped prepare supper. Megan was feeling very tired so I went and dropped Lucy off. Got her there a little early this time. Then came back and Megan and I proceeded to take a nap on the sofa for our quite time at home. We both felt nicely rejuvenated after it. Then I went and picked up Lucy and played video games with Ben. We managed to beat Truth and Reconciliation on Legendary. Next week though is the silliness that is "Silent Cartographer" I look forward to taking warthogs everywhere we shouldn't. 
### October 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Entering the final phase of the garage door project
2. An interesting problem to tackle yesterday
3. A warm day yesterday

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of slightly sick Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday was more cool down concerns. One of the ones I decided to tackle was the retirement of the login ms. This ended up being a can of worms since I wanted to not only retire it, but also write documentation on such so that when this rare activity comes up we don't miss anything. This lead to a long discussion with ops in which they explained that harness should be doing a lot of the clean up. So I made a new pipeline for retiring a microserivce. Overall a great success and good demonstration of me going the extra mile. Trying to stack up those points for a promotion next year.
After work I went out and started working on the garage. I got the painting done and then lapped the house and declared myself done with that painting as well. By that time I felt like the tape had dried enough so I pulled the tape. It came off relatively nicely and I was pleased with the result. Next I started working on the weather strip. I got the strip tacked in place before supper. Then after supper Megan and Lucy went on a scavenger hunt which bought me the time I needed to triple the number of nails in that strip so it was held in place properly. It does look better than the last one did. But that is just the top strip of Urbosa's door so I'm not done yet! And while I would like to say that the weather strip is the final task, and technically it is, I need to touch up the pink paint because I got some blue paint on it in a few spots. :facepalm:
After that we played TotK. I was intent on finishing the quest to find all the light roots. To accomplish such we had to complete the Akkala labyrinth. That was un-expected. It ended up taking most of the evening. We've clearly missed a light root though as I just checked and we are supposed to get a little reward for finding all the light roots. Oh well, for next time I suppose.
### October 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fixing things succeeding
2. Garage door work completing
3. Hopeful child conceiving

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has begun prepping our adoption portfolio

Entry

Friday I pound on the chassis migration of Client API for the most part. My brain was tired by the time I finished it. After work we did a round of disc in the park, possible the last round of the year if the weather continues the trend it is heading towards. We came back and I started working again on weather stripping for the garage door. I got one vertical done and started on the top of the bike door, but ran out of time before supper and it was getting dark afterwards so I called it a night and decided I'd continue that activity in the morning. I forget what I did the rest of that evening. Probably just various small tasks.
Saturday morning I slept in a little and made Chocolate Zucchini bread for breakfast. We watched our episode of Jordan Peterson while Lucy watched Blues clue which was a far more enjoyable experience when we aren't pausing every 30 seconds for a Lucy complaint. After that I went to the dump and started working on the weather stripping on the garage. I completed it just before lunch and declared that project fully and completely done! Huzzah! Garage doors look great. I had lunch, took my nap, gave Urbosa the last carwash of the year and some other chores. I made a little progress cleaning the garage. I also made progress cleaning my desk by repairing a few items that were sitting there. Most notably I felt good about myself fixing Lucy's bubble gun because I needed to replace a switch but I didn't have one that matched. By luck one of my momentary switches fit in the spot on her gun just fine and so I merely needed to flood the cavity it was gently resting on with hot glue to cement it in place and everything was dandy!
The bug to further refine my desk has bit me again. This time it started with my soldering iron. I think I'll need to replace it soon. The ignitor on it doesn't work very consistently anymore. In order to get it to ignite what I ended up doing was hitting it with the propane torch until the solder itself got hot enough to ignite the butane flowing out of it. Less than ideal. So I'm starting to think about getting an electric one. Specifically the Pine64 Pinecil. Nothing like a good open source project! But that device is also smaller so I would be able to store it in one of the drawers on my desk which is awfully appealing. I'm having similar thoughts about the multi meter, and as a result have found a nice petite multi meter that will fit nicely into the drawer with my oscilloscope. I put some of these things on my Christmas wish list, we'll see what comes to fruition. 
Sunday was decent. Lucy was sick so couldn't go to Sunday school and I was running sound. So Lucy sat in the sound booth with me and watched a show on Argon. It worked well enough. After church we relaxed a bit and I got a bit of communication about Archer Christmas handled. We finished finding all the light roots on TotK. We had an early supper as I had DnD that evening as a result of cancelations in other times. It was a good session. Though I tried to be a better tank by not focusing on doing damage but on protecting people. Turns out nothing targeted me so I was basically worthless and then I dealt a remarkable amount of damage. I did burn a daily and an encounter power to do such though. 
### October 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An imune system
2. SCAD
3. A pretty good night's rest

Thing I love about Megan: 
Made me an elf hat!

Entry

Yesterday I finished up the chassis work, had book club about the ideal team player, and some other smaller stuff. A decent day. After work I went on a bike ride to get some exercise. Then I dug a compost hole. I went down stairs to my printer to make some measurements of it as I try to figure out how to do a case for the RPI and the components I want to put inside with it. We had supper and I went back to that project. I did some puzzling but got started on the work and made some progress before I called it a night. Most notably I mocked out everything in the case so I could see that it wasn't going to all fit. Frustrating. But this is what cad is for, figuring these things out before I make any real commitment.
### October 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Progress on testing went fairly well.
2. Cough drops
3. Cozy beds

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves lucy

Entry

Yesterday was a bunch of meetings it felt like. But got some important things done. 
After work we went for a walk to enjoy the fall air and find some fallen leaves. We came back and had supper. After supper was Lulu time, she just wanted to play mario kart. Since I was feeling under the weather I did not argue. But I really wish I could help her get better. She over steers and ends up getting frustrated when I give her suggestions. I guess she isn't ready to learn yet. After that I worked more on the case for the octo print server. It's slow inching progress as I try to make various requirements harmonize. It's tricky. But I think I am making progress.
### October 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Healthy enough to go to the pumpkin carnival
2. A solid night's sleep
3. Pure hilarity with Ben last night playing through the silent cartographer.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Made me an elf out fit at last minute.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on getting client api out the door and a couple other things. It was a pretty good day all in all.
After work we had some snacks before getting dressed and heading to the pumpkin carnival. I got a couple of compliments for my out fit paired with Lucy's Santa, who was really the star of the pair. Megan did a great job with Lucy's santa outfit. After that we came home and it was basically game time with Ben. I turned down the difficulty so we could have fun with it. We took warthogs just about the whole way to both internal objectives. it was hilarious. Such a silly level, I love it. 
### October 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My soar throat is almost gone.
2. The rain let up enough for me to do some winterizing last night.
3. A great growing season.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys completionism some times.

Entry

Yesterday was another day with meetings. I prepared for a meeting with Harness going over how we use our pipeline in front of one of their engineers so he could advise us on how to improve it. That meeting went a little long. I worked on client api and got it shipped by the end of the day despite my one on one and meeting with Drake to do tests. 
After work I went out into our backyard and winterized some things. Gathered the remaining pumpkins, cleared Lucy's cheery tomato vine, picked up and cleaned the tarp I was using as a weed block. Etc etc. We are expecting snow this weekend which is quite a shock. After that I worked on the RPi case for my 3d printer for a bit until it was supper time and then video game night. Still playing TotK getting some of the various little side quests and completing our wardrobe. 
### October 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Snow!
2. Cozy warm bed
3. Getting most the things I wanted done on time.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is pretty good at winging recipes these days.

Entry

Friday I spent the whole day poking at harness. It was mostly enjoyable except for a bug I could not explain by the end of the day. I did submit my changes for review so hopefully it was not a day wasted. I also had the unpleasant task of reverting my Client API migration again. There are so many little gotchas in that API. It is frustrating.
After work I sat down and relaxed a bit. Or tried to. Mostly I worked on my case design for the RPi octo print case. I got a design ready by bed time but being a 10 print I waited until the next day to actually pull the trigger.
The next morning I had DnD in the morning so I headed out fairly promptly after breakfast. After I got home I was content to lean into the relaxing (I unfortunately forgot to start the printer until after I got home). I took my nap and sat down at my computer to poke around a bit but eventually decided to play some "TIS-100". So of course the first thing I did was print the manual. Quite the game to have as it's first step "print this 14 page manual" but I dig it. I got a decent ways into the game before I declared my mind to tired. I wasn't feeling the best, this cold is rallying for a last hurrah.
Sunday was busy. Went to church, I did some prep work between services for the pumpkin shoot out. Got everyone home and lunched and rested a bit before we headed out a bit before 2 for the pumpkin shoot out. It wasn't a bad day and for most of it the cold was quite tolerable. But eventually it started turning from chili to cold and being outside was less pleasant. However, before that, I did manage to get 5 out of 5 shots when skeet shooting. And I managed to put a couple dozen rounds through some pumpkins with an AR15. Though I need to learn how to watch better as I was really not learning much doing my practice shooting since I couldn't see the result of what I was doing most of the time. Came home. Played some tis-100 before I decided I was again to tired and retreated to just simply read for a bit.
### October 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Warm clothes
2. The excitement of Nano starting tomorrow
3. Quite calm days.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has hammered through most of the paper work for the adoption process already.

Entry

Yesterday I took a very programmer approach to solving the problem of which logging service do we want to use. I wrote a script to help me. I created json files for each potential service and then setup yes no questions for the group to whittle down the list. I more or less just got right back to where me started, but we are standing there now with confidence that there aren't other options. And then I read the ideal team player book.
After work I had a pretty chill day. Trying to mostly rest leading up to Archer Christmas hoping to kick this cold before then. But I did some work on the RPi case for the printer and played with Lucy some. I've taken to reading hack-a-day articles as a positive news feed to read rather than world news.
### November 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Fun halloween costumes
2. Lucy having a good experience going trick or treating.
3. A nice calm night wrapping up October

Thing I love about Megan: 
Relaxes with Video games.

Entry

Yesterday I did a bunch of reading in the first part of the day, trying to stay awake for a good portion of that reading. Then we had ideal team player discussion, I decided on a application to test this cycle (elastic search) and I ended the day by bug hunting the bug that ruined my day on friday.
After work we had supper and then took Lucy trick or treating. Megan and I were marveling a little at how good this is for her. a lot of practice going up to stranger's doors, knocking, saying something, receiving something, thanking them, and leaving. That is some good social practice when you realize that the majority of human social interactions are actually fairly similarly pre-canned. We got around 2 blocks and called it a night as she was getting quite cold and had plenty of candy. 
I worked on the octo-print case, I hope to print the final version today, and Megan played TotK and we all generally relaxed while Lucy eat her candy.
### November 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good start to nanowrimo
2. A lot of administrivia done.
3. My odroid gameboy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is good at planning.

Entry

Yesterday was mostly eaten up by administrivia. But my annual safety review complete and my annual health insurance is complete. So we are doing well.
After work I started writing. Nano is here! I got 2.5k words in yesterday. I'm having fun. That is of course how nano starts. My current record is 12k words, we'll see how far I can get this year. Technically my bullet journal objective was simply "participate in NaNoWriMo" so in theory I am already done! I have participated. :success: I say that in jest, but it is important to remember. I don't HAVE to finish, but I would like to. After that I played Halo with Ben. We managed to get through assault on the control room on legendary. We'll see how well we can hack the library on such. That's going to be a slog. But I think we can pull off guilty spark without much issue.
### November 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A long weekend with family
2. Fun games and toys
3. Safe trip to and from

Thing I love about Megan: 
Handles so many things so well at events like Archer Christmas.

Entry

Thursday I worked on more administrivia to my great dismay. But I got to some interesting work before the end of the day. After work time was mostly spent in preparation for departure. I still managed to get a good number of words in on Nano. 
The next day we loaded up and headed out. Picked up my mom for the last time for this event. Starting next year she'll be driving over with Brady and Julie. Unfortunately due to scheduling issues Brady, Julie, and Sam were un-able to meet us at Perkins for lunch. We made our way to the lake house and got our stuff unloaded and headed in. I worked on my nano book for a while until Ethan and Gina arrived. I helped where I could in the prep of the chili and Kennan and Alaina arrived while it was cooking. We played some games and called it a night.
The next day Brady and Sam arrived mid morning. We setup the Rokenbok. It was mostly me and Brady. It does give me a moment of pause as the Rokenbok seems to be mostly a toy for us adults yet. There is the possibility that we won't bring it next year if we (hopefully) have a crawling infant or two whom we wouldn't want to get near for their own safety and the safety of the rokenbok. Brady brought RC cars which worked well for this group since they lasted like 30 minutes and so were only play able for so long.
Over all the weekend went well. Our tastes are clearly changing in games and food. It is quite interesting. One notable event was when I played some video games with just Mom on the switch in portable mode. She appreciated the calmer introduction to a game so she could actually track what was going on.
We made our way home Monday and Lucy slept most of the trip. Over the whole weekend I managed to keep my out put at about 1k words so I am still doing well on the nano front. I've tied my record of 12k words already and I still have a lot of interesting things to write.
### November 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good time last night making cookies
2. Being ahead of schedule on Nano
3. Friends with trucks.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Challenges assertions I make to keep me sharp.

Entry

Yesterday I was mostly playing catch up and putting out fires that had popped up while I was away. I hate daylight savings. It screws things up.
After work I finally got back to doing exercise. I don't feel sick for the most part and my ankle has recovered. Life can resume! Lucy sat down with me and even did some of my exercises with me for the whole period I was exercising. It was cute. I would have rather listened to an audio book, but I can listen to those after she is grown. I ended up spending quite a bit of time with her last night actually since it was also "papa time!" last night. We made sugar cookies. It took a lot longer than I expected and we played memory while they cooked. I got a little reprieve while the cookies cooled so I could do a little bit of writing. Then we frosted the cookies which Lucy had a lot of fun doing. She put WAY to much frosting on one and then a mere suggestion of frosting on several that followed. It was hard for her to get it right. But it was cute and we had fun. That's what matters.
### November 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A loving family
2. A fun story
3. A mostly healed body

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has done a lot of work to get the adoption process rolling.

Entry

Yesterday I started hacking on elastic search. Got preview flowing in, now I need to get staging.
After work I planted the tulip bulbs my mom gave us and went for a run. I was pretty worn out so was unable to complete the full 3.1 miles. I had to stop and walk 2 maybe 3 times I forget. Hopefully I can get some stamina back up, but I'll probably switch to stationary bike riding here soon. 
We had supper and I did some writing. I'm make progress on the story and am currently on schedule to finish the book by November 25th. I'm trying to not burn myself out but I'm also happy to have a little buffer. 
Ben and I beat 343 Guilty Spark last night on legendary and were able to punch through the library on easy in a little under 25 minutes, getting us the par time for the level. That was fun. We did indeed felt like demigods after having played on legendary. I hope we can manage the library next week in the hour and a half time that we'll have to hack it. 
### November 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Forgiveness
2. A nice relaxing evening
3. Book Cases

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks through things.

Entry

Yesterday I finally got some progress on the elastic search project. Now I need to decide on how I compare these tools.
After work I pounded out some words. Got nearly 2k done. Ended on a cliff hanger. Exciting. I look forward to seeing how many I can bang out over the weekend.
Played some more TotK, completing various tasks. I spent a fair bit of time working on shrines. I'll follow up with Megan soon and see if she's ready to move on yet. 
### November 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A new book shelf
2. A cozy cubbie
3. A lot of words done.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves others.

Entry

Friday I spent most of my time hammering on some code to test our logging systems. I may have spent to much time on it, but we shall see. After work we went for a walk, Lucy melting down by the end of it as per usual. Managed to hammer out 4532 words that evening though. At this rate not only will I finish, I will finish well ahead of schedule. As of this morning I was at 28k words. 
Saturday I loaded up and headed off to Orange City with Skylar. It was nice to have some time to just chat the two of us. We discussed a lot of good things. We borrowed his father's truck and were able to get all the remaining big pieces of furniture out of my mom's place. Most importantly the queen size bed that Megan's folks will be sleeping upon this thanks giving. Unfortunately we were unable to get a small book case up the stairs so we have an extra large bookshelf now that we will have to dispose of. Give to a friend or sell. After we got back to vermillion with that furniture Skylar and I had a quite turn around for DND that afternoon. Had a little time to write in the evening there was a lot of little things to accomplish. 
The next morning I went to church early for praise team. I managed to patch together my wireless keyboard and my tablet to be able to work on my book while I was sitting waiting at church. Probably the only time I'll need that particular setup, but it worked well. After church we went to Akron to meet up with my Mom since Skylar and I forgot the bookshelf clips on Saturday. We got those transferred first to be sure we wouldn't forget and then we let Lucy and my mom play for a while. With mom moving to Decorah soon her opportunities for such are rapidly dwindling. 
We came back, got the study organized with the new bookshelf and then had only about half an hour of down time before we headed off to church for "Call to Freedom". That was a good event. We learned a fair bit and were pleased with how they portrayed things. They didn't make you walk away thinking "oh my gosh my child isn't safe at a playground!" but rather, talk to you're kids, even your adult kids. Make sure they know abuse isn't normal.
Came home and did some dishes and prep and got a little more writing in before bed.
### November 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Great progress on my Nanowrimo project.
2. Great progress on this logging experimentation project
3. My nice coosie cubie. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very attractive.

Entry

Yesterday I hammered on the script and got GrayLog and Elastic search operating so I could run tests. Success. I also did the more subjective parts of this task.
Afterwork I ran, and then sat to do some writing. Had supper, and went back to writing. By the time bed time rolled around I was to 34k words in total. That puts me at 16k words to complete in 17 days, or 950 words per day, or my current expected end date of the 19th, which is wholly a possibility. The next few days though I expect to not get quite as many words as Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday all have commitments. But I am very excited to see that I will probably be a successful run at Nanowrimo. 
### November 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good job
2. Some quiet time
3. Lovely weather.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Still loves doing Shoeboxes every year.

Entry

Yesterday I got the rubric into a position where I'm now just waiting for critique.
After work I did my exercise. Lucy is insistent on joining me and it is quite a drag. I want to just zone out and listen to a book or watch a mindless youtube video, I actually perform better that way with my mind half taken off of the task so I'm not complaining. This won't last forever, so I'm just grinning and bearing it for now. I got a little writing in before supper. Then after supper Lucy was whining and so we didn't got straight into papa time. So I got another hour of writing before Papa time. We played "Mountain Goats" and Lucy trounced me. We are going to bring it along to New Years and let the precocious preschool pass everyone their posterier in a math game. Then got a little more writing in before the end of the evening. I've got to keep my self in check at this point that I don't accidentally bring the story to a conclusion to soon, that would be an unfortunate way to come up short on my word count.
### November 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Hopes for more children by adoption
2. Fun playing games with Ben.
3. Nearing the end of my book. Just 12000 words to go.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is handling all the paper work regarding adoption.

Entry

Yesterday I did some cleaning up in harness mostly. After work we had supper and headed off to drop Lucy off for cubbies. While Lucy was there we swung by the sheriff's office and got finger printed for state and federal levels as part of the home study process. We had some time to ourselves at home and then I went to pick up Lucy from Cubbies. Played through "the Library" with Ben and managed to get through it on Legendary. I thought it was a really long level but it wasn't to bad. I'm convinced that they changed the number of enemies you encounter in this remastered version so that they could introduce "par" times.
### November 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Some good times with TotK.
2. Confession
3. Another quite day

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans well.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on various things. I forget what exactly, it wasn't a very interesting day.
After work, did some writing and had supper. I managed to clear 40k words. I'm on the home stretch now. If I can just jabber on for another 10k words I can finish. Those only 4 more chapters at my current rate. One a day and I'll be done by Monday. Fingers Crossed. I will have achieved something I've wanted to do since I was like 14. Homeschooler success. After that Megan and I played our final video game night of Tears of the Kingdom. Half a year we have spent on this game. It is time to move on. 
### November 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Finishing NaNoWriMo for once.
2. Git back journal and notes.
3. A game to teach me to make a CPU.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can make babies!

Entry

Friday I did some more puttering around and reading at work. Waiting for the comments to come back on my rubric. By the end of the day I had them so today, monday, I will be able to hammer on them. 
After work we decided to not go for a walk immediately, but instead wait till later and go when it was fully dark. I got some writing in. That was about it. Cleared all the furniture so I could mop the floors.
The next morning watched the Space X live stream and got to enjoy the world's largest rocket getting to space AND blowing up. Spectacular. Mopped the floor, made breakfast. Had an over all quite casual morning as there wasn't anything particularly planned. Took a nap. Did some writing. Set about doing a number of other tasks. We moved the sofa and cleaned below it. Patched up the spots on the wall next to the windows where the window sill had been previously. Looked into what it will take to replace the bathroom fan, a whole Saturday at this point is my expectation. Also got back to fiddling with my printer. Trying to finish up the refinement task there of having case for the RPi. Got it all packed away, just need to print a lid. 
Sunday came, slept in till 8. Went to church. I came home. Worked mostly on the lid for my printer. Ran into some frustrating problems with the printer's behavior and decided to set it aside for now. Will return to it hopefully today. Did some writing and then went to pick up Megan and Lucy from church. Got home, had some lunch, took a nap. Lucy was being very whiny but eventually we forced her to take a nap and she napped for hours. I was able to finish my book. And I am SO glad to be done. It was fun. I remember doing this when I was younger, just sitting around writing stories. But with NaNaWriMo having a target and all, the last few chapters weren't the greatest. And introduce certain problems for sure if I were to try to make this a cohesive universe. But I hit my required numbers and can now say, after learning about it when I was like 15, I've done it. I've tried I think 4 times and now have actually succeeded. 
After I finished I decided to download a game that will help me achieve another long held goal of mine, make a processor. The game is called "Turing Complete" and it has been great thus far. Played that on into the evening. Got through all the basics and a fair bit of arithmetic and memory. I hope to have some more time to play it tonight, I've got the coins saved up in habitica for a full hour. 
### November 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A neat educational game with Turing Complete.
2. A lot of work done yesterday while still not feeling overly burdened.
3. Hope for a Baby. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes care of so many concerns of the house so I don't have to.

Entry

Yesterday I got most of the Graylog3 writeup done and a decent chunk of Elastic Search. I just this morning got some info from security on their needs so I'll be researching that up and following up with Graylog3 before I press onward.
After work I ran, managed 30 minutes so I'm holding at that 10 minute mile mark. Good enough for now. I'll try harder next spring but the running year is almost over. I spent a while trying to figure out what is wrong with my printer and how to fix it. I have yet to succeed on that point. Will try again tonight. After that I sat down to play some Turing Complete. Got a decent ways through. I'm into CPU architecture now. I got stuck on the conditionals last night. I could have sworn that the instructions were flipping on me. I didn't quite finish it before the night was up. But I believe I have it complete I just need to get it wired correctly.
### November 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Thanks giving
2. Megan's Family
3. Some time to rest and relax

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has a lovely family

Entry

Was very distracted at work last tuesday. Not to surprising considering it was the last day before a holiday. Had Lulu time that evening and got to play a little more Turing Complete. Still quite enjoying the game.
Wednesday I spent a large portion of it just distracting Lucy so that Megan could do house prep. That evening family arrived at bed time. Thursday we had our feast and played some games. Friday we mostly built our large "gingerbread houses" which were in fact made of grahm cracker isntead. None of us are terribly found of gingerbread and grahm cracks are cheap and plentiful. So this worked well. After that I got Ben, Hannah, and Josh to go outside and play with Lucy there. Making good use of that leaf pile. We had a short bonfire and played a few more games in the evening. Saturday we got out after lunch and went for a hike. It also snowed. That was exciting. Played "Call 911!" in the evening and caused an emotional break down in Hannah as a result. There was a long discussion to pull apart the feelings Hannah was having that were causing her to be so frustrated. We ended up forgetting to go out for a Guys night as a result. Oh well. Maybe next time.
Sunday we went to church, came back and it was mostly time to pack up. After people had packed and left I took a nap and played some Factorio while listening to "12 Rules for Life" I want to make sure I get all the way through it this time before my borrow from the library runs out again. Chatted with Megan and Nathan in the evening. It sounds like he and Sam are likely to be wed at some point in the future, they have been in discussion about such. But there are some things, most notably Sam's faith, that they need to work through before Nathan feels he can in good conscious move forward. It sounds like they might be moving to California in a few months for a few years. Perhaps that will be the time that they can sort everything out.
Lucy has not had a lot of good sleep yesterday so we tried to have her go to bed early last night and I sat and read in my bed while encouraging her to go to sleep. But she didn't fall asleep until normal bed time. She did end up coming to our bed but not till like 4. I'll be happy when we can get back to her consistently spending the whole night in her room.
Other notable events. Jeff and Cyndi gave some Christmas presents, I got a pinecil! A new soldering iron to replace my slowly breaking butane powered one. I finally broke down and went electric again. But this was brought about because the soldering iron in question was highly recommended and open hardware. I approve certainly of the last thing, but the two together are hard to top. It can also be powered by USB-C, so long as you have a power-supply that can hack it. Fortunately my laptop's 100w power supply can cover that 60w demand for now.
And the most discouraging event was condensation on our windows. A lot of it. Enough that it was running down and making puddles on the brand new wood trip. Very upsetting. We are going to follow up with Greg to check if this is typical. 
### November 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An extra day with Nathan, mostly for Lucy.
2. My printer working again
3. A productive day at work.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves me

Entry

Yesterday worked on GHA issues and I worked on setting up a Loki instance in the cloud.
After work I setup the sofa lamp with it's new trio of bulbs. I was going to put lights in to the fan as well, but turns out it uses the small sockets rather than normal ones so that was a no go. Then I went to replace the dead bulb in the accent light by the dining room table and catastrophe struck. First the bulb failed to come out and I ended up twisting the bulb off the step and shorting out the circuit. Breaker tripped. I removed the bit of metal that remained and then tried putting a new bulb in. That one tripped the circuit as well. I decided to just leave it without a bulb. I turned the breaker on and it immediately tripped. Nathan went to the breaker box for me and switch the breaker and a jet of flame spewed out of the tiny socket before the lights came on and stayed on miraculously. In the end I just cut that socket out of the circuit and we called it a day. We'll need to replace that fixture at some point in the future.
I then worked on my printer for a bit. In the end, changing the name of the firmware file was enough to get the printer to re-flash. I did some tweaking but now the relay that controls it's power seams to be busted. AGH! I just want to finish this project. 
Then I sat and read till it was bed time. Early this morning, 3:40, I drove Nathan to the airport, we had some good talk about lust and self control.
### November 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good conversations
2. Safe travels for family returning home
3. A strong marriage.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is willing to work for our marriage.

Entry

Yesterday after I got back dropping off Nathan I worked on some more of the GHA tweaks and got automatic testing working for Loki.
After work I did exercise and then we had supper. Lulu time was enjoyable. We played Mario Kart and Lucy wanted to beat me. I turned on auto steering and auto acceleration and actually ended up taking a nap. Nice. 
I went upstairs and left Lucy to watch a show while Megan and I had some time alone together. It ended up being a very intense conversation. I was feeling sexually frustrated and I wanted to figure out how to get past that. We've had this conversation several times before and it hasn't done much good. The severity of it was starting to come home this time as I pointed out that this is the sort of problem that could lead to a divorce if not rooted out. We could both hear the anxiety and pain in each others voices I'm sure. Some of this was spurred on by me having to confess to having looked at porn that day. We walked away from the conversation with some actionable items that will hopefully benefit our marriage. Megan did have a little bit of a melt down later in the evening. Things we'll need to discuss probably the coming planning day.
### November 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My printer printing again
2. A healthy fear of death
3. Fun ideas for Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is creative and wants Lucy to have fun.

Entry

At work I researched graylog and did some other stuff. Not a lot to talk about right now.
After work I ran. Managed to come in just under 30 minutes. Then I fiddled with my printer. The relay that controlled the power seemed to have gotten stuck. Fortunately I was able to just cycle it a few times to get it to come free. I'm not sure what was the reason for that happening but I'm glad it works now. I'll bear in mind that I may have to replace that relay at some point in the future. But, the important thing is Reginn is now printing again! Huzzah! Hopefully I can finally finish the "refine 3d printer case" task. I need to get that lid printed today for me to be able to declare it a success today.
After supper Megan and I went down to Lucy's playroom and did some imagining. We are thinking about how to put up some climbing space there for Lucy. We have some good ideas I think but we'll need to hack on them a little further to refine them into plans. We also cleaned up all the ball pit balls so we can get Lucy's ball pit out properly again. We did this also because Mezzo has been peeing on the floor, we think because he's un-happy about the cone. We cleaned all the pee covered balls aswell. 
Then Megan gave me a hair cut. Then I played "Keyes" with Ben before calling it a night.
### December 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good month of November
2. Excitement for Advent of Code
3. Hopes for another child.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Handled all the home study paper work.

Entry

Yesterday I did some tutelage of Emily on deployments and gave a presentation about what I have seen so far in my experiments with logging services. 
During the work day my printer finished printing a lid for my RPi that runs the printer. I made some mistakes in the model and had to clip bits of it off for it to fit. There are other problems with the case I designed as well but for now it does everything I asked of it so I'm calling it a win and declaring that refinement task complete. My printer is now a fully self contained device that I can just pick up and bring with me some where if I so desired. 
After work I went to the hardware store to get a peasant loaf for supper. While I was there I discovered Ace now has a large candy isle. I realized before I left that this was an opportunity to surprise Megan with flowers and chocolate. Plans slightly changed, I got her licorice instead of chocolate as that was what was available in the candy isle. Then I went to the new flower shop, but by then they were closed. So I went to hyvee and grabbed 3 roses. I presented these to Megan upon return and told her they were a thank you for the effort she had put forward on Tuesday for showing initiative in our love making. One must always reward good behavior.
After supper we did some cleaning up of extra beds. We've decided to sell the 4" foam pad and collapsable box spring. We don't use them all that often, and I don't think the box spring does jack. I think if I was on the 4" foam pad I'd prefer the floor over the box spring. Megan right now is on the war path to dispose of the pile of stuff we have accumulated for disposal. We are developing I think a health lower tolerance for having junk around. 
Then I took a nap and then we started playing "A short hike". This game was specifically chosen because we thought Lucy might be able to play it as well. And right we were! The camera is mostly locked on the game so Lucy only had to contend with navigation not navigation and camera control. She handled it admirably. We are only planning on playing the game at most 5 weeks. But it may not even last that long. We technically beat it last night but there is still quite a bit of content to explore. 
### December 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Our first adoption match, even if we turned it down.
2. A good home study
3. A lovely decorated house

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has done a lot of work to get us this far in the adoption process

Entry

Friday I had a pretty chill day at work, starting with the company gingerbread building event. Lucy of course enjoyed that. Other than that I mostly hacked on graylog 5 to try to get logs flowing into it as well.
After work I have forgotten what I did over all. But I believe it was mostly associated with sorting out backups. I think I've found a software that I like at last for this. That's happy.
Saturday was christmas decorating day. I made biscuits for breakfast and we watched another portion of JP on genesis and then I cleaned the upstairs before we headed out to the christmas tree farm. We picked out our tree and brought it home. Lucy was very excited for the whole process. We got it decorated and while Megan continued decorating I did my Advent of Code challenges. I also designed a little magnetic clip to try to hold the christmas lights to the underside of the book shelf along the top of the wall. But I couldn't get enough strength in the clips and we ended up just taping the lights in place. I then came back and added magnets on top of the tape to help keep it from slowly peeling. So in the end the magnets are doing the real work, but tape was a much better way to get there.
Sunday in the morning after church I cleaned the kitchen in preparation for the home study at 2. The home study went great. And we even had a match emailed to us while we were being interviewed. We looked at the match after the interview and decided to turn it down. There were just a few to many cons to the particular situation. Most notably a likely NICU stay down in Florida. We could handle going to Florida. We could handle a NICU stay. But the two together was a bit rough. And the lady doing our homestudy before she left, and therefore before we had read this match, recommended we not jump at the first match. Trust our gut. So we leaned on that advice.
Watched DnD:Honor amongst Thieves last night. We are back to pizza movie nights after about a 6 month hiatus.
### December 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Backup plans coming together
2. My cycle coming to conclusion
3. A happy family

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is very smart and capable woman.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on trying to figure out the graylog5 api. Then after lunch I worked on solving a problem for QA to make merge conflicts more visible.
After work I ran. Then I did my advent of code challenge, 28 minutes. We had supper during which I chatted with Megan about backups. During that conversation I hatched a new plan for our backup situation. Rather than having a hot backup off site we are going to have a cold backup. I'm going to hand naught but a hard drive to Brady for him to keep some where safe-ish. This will allow us to have a backup of our photos and such off site. Even if it isn't kept up to date, we will merely have a gap rather than loose everything. Great plan. Started working on clearing the old hard drive to do that.
### December 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Co-workers to talk to about advent of code when I get stuck.
2. That I didn't ruin everything on my server.
3. Some fun times with Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is frugil.

Entry

Yesterday I finished up getting autorubric to run against graylog 5. Now I have the ability to run tests on graylog3, graylog5, loki, and elastic search and compare their results. This really helped drive home that elastic search is our best choice. After that I hacked on getting a slack notification for QA when there are merge conflicts. I managed to get it to work just before the end of the day so today I'll need to clean it up.
After work Lucy and I went immediately over to the playground to enjoy it one last time before it gets cold. I can't till we have another little one. Play on the playground by our selves isn't the most fun. But Lucy was happy and I didn't roll my ankle this time. :success: After supper I started working on my advent of code challenge for the day. This one took me 8 minutes just to read. I managed a solution by 73 minutes, but it turned out to be wrong. Or so I thought. I must have just miss typed or something. I posted about it in the slack channel and Andrew Keller commented that my code was correct it was just my input that was broken. I didn't adjust the input, I merely re-ran it and got the right answer this time so I'm guessing I just typoed when I entered the answer. But it never the less left me sad last night. But at least this morning I've gotten part 1. We'll see about part 2. I don't want to bog myself down to much so I may skip it depending on how fast I get through tonight's challenge.
Did some more work on our backups. The night before I had started a process to copy the contents of Balder, the hard drive I had left at my mom's, over to Udgard for safe keeping and to make space for new backups. I will want to go through those old backups at some point I think but for now they are just taking up space. But little did I know I set myself up for a trap. I blew out the hard drive space on Udgard and brought it down for the count. It's virtual disk and over flowed the physical disk, but this was mostly due to the fact that the physical disk also had about a TB of data on it that Udgard-docker was un-aware of. Sooooo, started clearing some of that out so the virtual disk could expand and allow the machine to keep operating. Once I got that dealt with I started working on getting data shuffled around for protection sake. Most notably I am now copying Megan's pictures onto Balder, my pictures to follow suit after her's. Those will be the most important pieces to get in place. Once that is done I can breath a little easier. 
### December 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Backups moving along
2. Fun puzzles to solve for advent of code.
3. A quite Christmas season coming up.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of Lucy

Entry

Yesterday I mostly did some writing. Preparing my document for the declaration that we are using Elastic Search for our logs and writing up a pitch that will tackle that decission.
After work, oh, I was supposed to run but I plainly forgot. It was a cubbies night so this is not unusual. Lucy didn't end up going to cubbies so I potentially could have run, but the final decision was not made until after supper and I don't like running on a full stomach. I then spent almost all of my remaining time working on day 5 of advent of code. I have put a hard limit of 2 hours per question to maintain my sanity, so I'm not going to continue working on that question. However, as it happens, the brute force option I had deployed and forgot about completed so I did end up getting it. HAHA! After that I played "The Maw" with Ben and beat it on legendary. We started playing Cairo Station but the internet crapped out on us so we couldn't finish. We then played Generals and Ben beat me in his first couple of tries. 
### December 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Backups coming along
2. Fun playing "A short hike" with Lucy.
3. A quiet night at home.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Enjoys challenges.

Entry

Yesterday I dug into a logging issue that a member of Next was having.
After work we vascilated on whether to go to the stand still parade of lights, but with Lucy still feeling out of sorts we opted to not. I spent 86 minutes solving the advent of code problem. I saw some of the real value of writing unit tests to make sure I got the code assembled correctly. I feel like I was able to keep thoughts straight by the use of test to force me to chunk up the logic. I'm starting to be converted. 
After that we had some icecream for our candy and then played more "A short hike" with Lucy. Who had a lot of fun. And then we went on a short walk of our own to round out the evening.
### December 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A basement a little cleaner
2. Fun ideas for things for Lucy
3. Co-workers to help me over advent of code challenges.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is always learning.

Entry

Friday I did some writing to get my pitch broken into two pitches. These are the first pitches I have written and I do expect that they will be accepted at some point, though not immediately. Their timing will depend on a lot of things outside my control so I won't hold my breath. It is a reminder that some times the work one does that gets most recognized is just your normal work. I guess, you know, the work you've been asked to do eh?
After work I tried to do the advent of code challenge and got stumped. Grumble. Read some of the "Design Patterns" book. Prepared some pumpkin puree for the next morning.
Made pumpkin bread the next morning. Attempted the advent of code challenge for saturday and was stumped again. Grumble. Spent the majority of the afternoon cleaning up in the basement. It looks much better now. Though there are now a pair of containers full of random tech junk that I need to sort through. But it's progress. The laundry area looks much nicer now that the floor isn't covered in random wires. 
After that I spent a while working on CAD for Lucy's play area. I designed the platforms and made some measurements so we could order the climbing net we would use. I'll need to take a quick trip to the lumber yard to pickup some plywood to make this idea a reality, but that shouldn't be to hard. And I only need lumber for the flooring, I think I have enough 2x4 in my scrap pile to make the actual structure of the platforms. Perhaps I can start on that tonight. 
Sunday morning after church I played a little "Turing Complete" as I wanted to get back to that game. I made progress on the programming of my processor. I discovered the problem I had was that I just had a few instructions mixed up in my head. Sorted them out and it worked like a charm. Then I did some accounting to send to the lady doing our home study and went to pickup Megan and Lucy from church. 
After church I took a nap and then started working on the advent of code challenge. I paused early on and we took a decent walk. I got back and didn't quite finish it before it was time to stop for supper. I think it shouldn't take me to much longer to resolve.
Got a little frazzled while making supper. Lucy is such and endless stream of noise. And just enough of it requires you to respond to drive one batty some times. And then we watched the paw patrol might movie, which unfortunately scared Lucy. We worked with her for a bit to try to get her over her fears. She was fighting back and forth and was trying to leave right as the scary parts ended. I think some desensitization exercises will do her some good as I don't think she's genuinely afraid per se, of the things on screen. She is experiencing emotions and just doesn't know how to handle them seems to be the sum of it. So we just need to help her learn to manage those emotions. If we limit our selves to only g rated films without scary scenes we are going to have a very small range of movies to watch together. 
### December 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My body recovering
2. No one other than me getting sick
3. A pitch that had some time in the cycle

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took good care of Lucy and myself while I recovered.

Entry

Monday was pretty good, at least during the work day. I did some writing and helped Andrew Keller tackle some metrics questions he had. I ended up talking with Andrew until the end of the work day, and as that end was coming I started feeling off.
After work I went out for a run, maybe my stomach issues would go away with some exercise. They did not. I rapidly fell apart. I got home and sat for a bit and threw up before supper. Considering it hit me rapidly and only me, we think it was food poisoning. I'm still on the mend. But I can actually think some what clearly today. So that was also basically all of Tuesday. I lounged, I defected a lot of liquid, I tried to at least read or do something productive, the reading I managed fine, but that was about it. Hopefully today will be better.
### December 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Stomach on the mend
2. An exciting lights and Santa display to show Lucy
3. Fast response times

Thing I love about Megan: 
Isn't sick yet. Here's hoping.

Entry

I felt light headed all day yesterday. It was a bit rough. Kinda hard to focus. But I managed to do some work. After work I ate a non-trivial amount of supper, most importantly all my salmon. I had maybe a 70% portion. But once again I felt stuffed to the brim later in the evening. And even now the next morning I still don't feel hungry. After supper we headed off to the Santa display down in Nebraska. Lucy, being a year older, really enjoyed it this year. She was so excited by all of it. So many Santas. However on the way home she threw up in the car. We thought maybe it was car sickness, but she proceeded to throw up again in bed. The reaction time between myself and Megan was interesting. I specifically recall that Megan woke up before I did (because her movement woke me), but we both kind of agree that I was moving before she was. That being said, this all happened inside of a second or two and we were both in Lucy's room super fast to make sure she was alright. We cleaned her up and her bed and brought her to our bed for the night. She threw up once more that I am aware of because after that time I retreated to the guest room so I could focus on getting my own sleep for my own recovery. We are now not so sure I was hit with food poisoning of course.
### December 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Starting to get back on my feet
2. A comfy sofa
3. Some good sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a thoughtful planner.

Entry

Yesterday I muddled through work, but was over all not to bad. I'm eating food again but I still don't have an appetite. Lucy unfortunately hasn't improved much. She spent all of yesterday in a drowsy cuddly fog and threw up again just before bed time. I managed to get back on to the advent of code train just enough to accomplish a single challenge to keep myself from drifting further behind. We'll see if I can catch up.
### December 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A relaxed weekend
2. A good time at DnD
3. Lucy's climbing platforms coming together quickly. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Gave me a good back rub

Entry

Friday at work I got wholly consumed in my efforts to improve the harness retirement microservice. Didn't finish but found some interesting things out.
After work I did my advent of code challenge and tried to catch up a bit. At this point I am going to be satisfied if I can even give an initial try to each of the challenges. That's better than a flat out giving up. Later that evening Megan and I had some time to our selves. Earlier that day our new massager gun and come and we were eager to give it a try. It was nice to have something that wouldn't tire as fast as our hands do. 
Saturday was a busy little day. I played some Factorio in the morning to "Bookorio" that is listen to some audio books. The two in question I was going to loose access to this coming week so I wanted to get them done so I could check them off. In the afternoon I worked on Lucy's climbing platforms. She wanted some where inside to climb and these are going to be the answer, as well as her Christmas present. The climbing net is scheduled to arrive today, we are going to wrap it and put it up for her on Christmas day. The hanging platform I will probably have to setup before that since it's setup will be a bit more involved. But since it is several feet from the floor she won't be able to access it until we setup the net anyway so all is well. In the evening was DnD. It was a pretty good session, including even getting eaten by the giant slime. My pool of health pulled me through that one for the most part.
Sunday came and we went to church for pastor Dan's final sermon before the Wilde family moves back to Montana. In the end we are thus glad we didn't expend a lot of effort in getting to know them. :shrug: After church I worked on Advent of code. My solution didn't work for the day. Darn. I picked up Megan and Lucy and went home. We got Lucy fed and then headed out to our hot date, as Megan called it earlier in the day. We were going to a progressive dinner theatre performance a Christmas carol. The four parts of the meal were in 4 different churches in town. It was an enjoyable event, I'm glad we did it. We then relaxed at home for a while and made pizza. We watched Titan A.E. in the evening and had some good discussion about it afterwards. It definitely isn't as good as I remembered, but I can see still a lot of the film that I loved as a child. And that said, it was still good and very enjoyable.
### December 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A successful puzzle solving last night
2. The retirement pipeline bending to my will :success:
3. Start of the hackathon

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took initiative last night.

Entry

Yesterday I recorded my review video in the morning and hammered on the retirement pipeline. I got the retirement pipeline to bend to my will which was great news. I'm pleased. It will do the clean up as we desired it to. I even got time at the end of the day to work on some hackathon work. :happyminion:
After work I had my first round of exercise on my exercise bike. It was 28 degrees out so just below my threshold for running. Then I worked on the Advent of Code puzzle for a bit, we had supper, I finished the puzzle, and by this point Lucy was getting cranky since she had had a very busy day and was driving both myself and Megan nuts. We went to bed early as a result and had some time to ourselves before hitting the sack. That was enjoyable.
### December 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Opportunity to game with team mates coming up
2. Opportunity to explore a rewrite of client api
3. Two days just me and Lucy. `\^_^/`

Thing I love about Megan: 
Trusts me enough to leave me home with Lucy for 2 days.

Entry

Yesterday I got Mark on track with his Postman collection for Billing and hammered on some harness issues for a bit. It is still reporting pods despite them having been all shut down for "Design System Docs".
After work I did my exercise. Lucy is still obsessed with coming down and watching me and participates in some of them as well. Mostly just the planking. After that we had supper. Then I took an hour and beat the Advent of Code puzzle for the evening. Did some minecraft server fiddling in preparation for tomorrow before heading to bed. 
### December 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good year at work
2. Fun games with Co-workers
3. A good night with Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is off having fun with her sisters.

Entry

Yesterday we had end of cycle game time. We started up a minecraft server. Everyone seemed to have fun, except maybe Todd who felt a little lost. We will hopefully get him engaged a bit more. Then it was the review videos. Then I hacked on receptor, my client api rewrite, for a while before calling it a day.
After work I made supper and Lucy and I played till 7:50. At which point we took a shower and she watched shows for the rest of the evening. We played a couple of games, and imaginative "hunting" game where we were going from room to room looking for things we liked and were beating up monsters along the way. I thought I was doing a decent job being with her. But she clearly still seemed to miss Megan. Perhaps I pushed to end papa time to soon. I wanted to get to my advent of code puzzle, all I asked was an hour in the evening. Perhaps that was a mistake. I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity I had last night to just hang out with Lucy by myself. We shall see. I'm doing better at not letting other things get in the way, but some times playing with a 4 year old is boring. So let the regret I feel now forever provide me motivation. That aside, bed time wasn't the worst. She slept in our bed and didn't keep me awake. So it was all good. 
### December 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good games with coworkers
2. Some time to just relax and enjoy myself
3. A-whole-nother week of hackathon

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is seeking Christmas traditions for our family.

Entry

Thursday and Friday I did get some hackathoning in but I largely spent the days play video games. I played probably close to 8 hours of games between minecraft and factorio. I have not let myself gorge myself on video games it a long time. I've not felt the interest in such. But it genuinely felt good. In a thanks giving day feast sort of way. Not something I want to do every day or even every month, once a year sounds great. It made me feel young again actually. Megan and I have commented about this. Getting lost in a book or a game is so much harder as an adult. So to have these moments of sheer abandon, playing for as long as I feel like it. It felt great. Now, additionally I am planning on giving up individual game playing for Winter Quarter, so I'm also going all fat Tuesday on these video games. That's going to leave me in a bit of a shock I am sure. xD
The weekend and Christmas were over all pretty relaxed. I think the highlight of the excitement was Lucy's new play structure. I build 2 platforms and attached them to the walls (and in the case of the taller one, ceiling) and we strung a net between them. A net strong enough to support me. Lucy now has a place to climb down in the basement and get some wiggles out in a place that won't drive Megan and myself insane. We are still ironing out details and seeing what could still be added to the mix, but over all it has been met with great approval. We hope she gets lots of fun out of the space. 
### December 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Ice packs
2. Fun swings
3. Inspiration for how our services could be better.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes lovely treats

Entry

Yesterday I got my concept of setting for individual devices up and working. It was a good day. After work I took a nap and then it was papa time. We setup Lucy's new fabric swing in the basement and proceeded to have fun on it. We played games involving her whacking into me and me pushing her away and between it all she fell and hit her head on the tile floor twice. Not so great. But she recovered fairly well and we kept playing after some minutes of tears and an icepack. We had supper, went out for eggs and a new snow shovel, and then came back and relaxed for the evening.
### December 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice quiet week.
2. Fun times playing games.
3. Good books to read. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes cuddling.

Entry

Yesterday I worked on getting the telemetry routes working. They are lower priority for this hackathon but I wanted to take a little time to see if there were any improvements to be made. Sure enough there were some things that could be improved. But still it was mostly a copy paste. 
After work I cleaned and shredded some potatoes to be our first batch of dried potatoes. They are still drying. Should be for another hour or so. Played a little with Lucy and played a little factorio. I'm realizing I might be able to finish the world I'm playing on in the time that I have left before the start of next quarter. That's enticing. We'll see if I can pull it off. After that Played some Halo2 with Ben. We got through the first arbiter levels. On to Delta Halo next week. 
### December 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Planning Day
2. FFVII
3. A good quarter and calendar year.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Plans!

Entry

Yesterday I hammered on security for receptor. Everything is now properly protected by JWTs. Nice. After work I played a little factorio while waiting for supper. Supper in the oven we went on a walk and then came back, had supper, and started our new game: Final Fantasy 7. The game from 1997. Megan's second Final Fantasy game. Much of my teen years are connected to this game even though I never finished it. I'm looking forward to doing such with Megan. I'm looking forward to the big moment in this game. One of biggest moments in video game history. We got through to Aeris's house. So we've got a ways to go yet before we can get out of Midgar and the game can let us roam free. Lucy seemed some what engaged with it.
### January 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good time with family
2. A good 2023
3. Handy Little tools.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Took care of Lucy for the most part while we were with my family.

Entry

Last Friday I didn't accomplish much in the way of work, instead, since Ray said we could, I was barely in the office. Megan and I took the day for our planning day instead. So plan we did. I also managed to complete my run through of Factorio so I didn't have that dangling and feeling incomplete during the exodus 90 challenge. 
Saturday we loaded up pretty promptly and drove off to Orange City for one of the last times, certainly the last time as a stop on the way to Dave and Tonya's. Picked up the Dental Cabinet to give to Kennan. We then made our way to Storm Lake. It was a good new-year's celebration. We stayed up till midnight. First time I've done that in a while. We didn't feel like getting Dave and Tonya more clutter for a Christmas present so we donated to Samaritan's purse in their honor. After Dave read the card is thanked us vigorously emphasising that a card with a nice word is really enough for him. That's good to hear. During the weekend we got some good games in and good conversation around. I actually had some good talk with Brayden. It did give me a moment of pause to remember that those two boys are as much a victim of my father's and their mother's infidelity as I am. Though it is also clear that now that they are grown and maturing into adults they are starting to put the muscle between their ears into use at last. One of the topics of discussion with Brayden was state income tax. So clearly he's thinking more adult now.
Made it home last night in time for my first fraternity meeting for the exodus 90 challenge. It's not going to be easy. But I think this is going to be a good challenge for me that I hope will see me grow significantly during it's period. The first cold shower last night was a rough one.
### January 3rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A productive hackathon
2. All the decorations packed up in one night
3. A happy Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of me.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on the MFE for receptor. It took me most of the day but I got it made and it works just the way I need it to. I also whipped up a quick example client to use for demonstration purposes. I finished the day working on my review and gathering my thoughts.
After work we packed up the Christmas decor, made supper, and it was time for papa time! Lucy was already working on setting up a party in the craft room so I came along side her and helped her make decorations and clean the room up. We then concluded Papa time by inviting Megan upstairs and having a little party. We then took the Christmas tree to the drop off and it was about time for bed. Last night's sleep was pretty aweful. Lucy is a bit out of sync with bed time right now due to new years eve celebrations. She was in our bed most of the night and Megan and I did not get much good sleep as a result. This morning I woke her at 7:30 and kept waking her up until Megan came down. Hopefully this will make her tired at bed time tonight.
### January 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good nights sleep
2. Attempts at morning prayer that will hopefully turn into successes
3. Completing my hackathon for the most part

Thing I love about Megan: 
Seems to be enjoying FFVII so far.

Entry

Apparently missed journaling yesterday. Woops. Wednesday continued hackathon. Mostly writing review at this point and trying to grasp at as many implications as possible. After work I played with Lucy at her request and then after supper hammered on my bullet journal. Got it all done and edited and ready to be printed, but it was time to play games with Ben. We played through Delta Halo and Regret, but had some really bad internet issues through much of it. We never actually finished Delta Halo, we got kicked out twice. 
Thursday I mostly wrote a pitch for doing a rewrite of Client API. My mind was in a fog most of the afternoon so I didn't make much progress on the review for a while. Later in the afternoon it cleared and I was finally able to finish up the review. After work I printed my journal, reprinted when I noticed an error, got it folded and placed under "The Art of Computer Programming" to press the folds. Tonight I'll bind it and my next quarter will be ready to begin. I had some time between that and video games so I started reading my Sextant book. So far it has kind of made me want to make an elementary navigation unit study. I'm realizing how simple so much of this is if you just take time to have some on explain the basic principals to you. We then picked up FFVII and got from Aeris's house to the foot of the Shinra building. At the rate we are going I think we could get through that next chapter and out of Midgar. 
### January 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A clean desk
2. A certain level of peace
3. Good times with the exodus90 challenge so far.

Thing I love about Megan: 
May conceive a child yet. 

Entry

Friday I helped Jeff with some issues relating to a chassis migration. After work I finished up my journal, bound the new pages onto the journal and then played with Lucy. Read some of my sextant book.
Saturday morning. woke up and did my reading. Made banana bread and went back to praying while it cooked. Was a productive prayer time since I was so awake. Then we had our morning bible study with Jordan Peterson and once again didn't actually get to the bible. We may skip out of genesis and go for exodus if things don't improve. Then I did some cleaning of my desk. This time I managed to get the whole surface of my desk cleaned, even the left corner where my projects sit. I got project boxes to store projects that are in progress. :success: Great improvement. Megan and I then went to "The Boy and the Heron" which was quite a film to be sure. A lot to decompress off of it. But it was a good film. We enjoyed it. Did a little more cleaning and tried to get through a lot my weekend tasks before supper. After supper went to Tiahrts and played a pair of rounds of Dominion. That was enjoyable.
Sunday. Got up early to try to get my holy hour in. Didn't get it all done before it was time to head to church. Tried doing it there and technically finished but it wasn't the best. Then we had a missions team meeting. Then we came home. I tried playing a little mine craft but Lucy was driving me nuts. I switched and started playing "The Guild 2" which is a game that I think will strike my fancy a bit. I just barely got started when I had to put it down for the rest of the week since I can't play video games normally. We had our first family game night last night, it was pretty good. Megan trounced myself and Lucy in memory. 
### January 9th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lots and lots of snow!
2. A nice warm house
3. Excitement around "Receptor" my Client API rewrite.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is cuddly

Entry

Yesterday I did some cool down concerns. Always nice to do a little cleaning house. After work I shoveled snow. We got so much! It was glorious. Then we had supper, stroganoff, and I trudged off to my Exodus 90 fraternity meeting. It went well. I look forward to a more devout week this coming week as the remainder of the Christmas treats dry up. Then I came home, and we had a displaced video game night as Megan is likely to have a meeting on Thursday evening. Almost finished Shinra tower. 
### January 10th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Excitement building around Receptor, mine if no one else's.
2. Lots and lots of snow
3. Time with friends.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday I started work and then paused for a bit so I could blow enough snow off the drive that Megan and Lucy could drive to the library. Lucy is feeling a tad under the weather so we didn't want to push it by having her ride a sled. When they got back Lucy was clearly coming down with something and slept most of the day. At work I did cool down tasks and did some more refining of my presentation. So excited to show it off today!
After work would have been Papa time but Lucy was still out. So I read my sextant book till supper. After supper played Minecraft with Lucy for a bit, but she wanted to go back to lying down so I stopped. I tried to do the budget but USAA was out for some reason so I ended up not being able to do that. Had some time with Megan, then read more sextant until it was time to play mine craft with Emily and Mark. We managed to get all the eyes of ender we needed for the next day to find a strong hold. Huzzah!
### January 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good presentation
2. Playing video games with friends and family
3. A good exercise

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has made the decision to stay home and stay safe. 

Entry

Yesterday I did other thing but mostly I gave my presentation on Receptor. I was a little disappointed that no one reached out to me about it after the meeting. But the enthusiasm during the presentation was pretty good. Hopefully I can utilize it. 
After work I was going to shovel snow but Megan wanted to do it to get out and get some exercise. So I went and exercised in the basement. I got 35 minutes on my exercise bike before I called it a day. I want to try to get up to 40. So this was a pretty good first exercise of the year. After exercise I showed, we had supper, we knew each other, and then Megan went off to shower while I went off to play games with Ben. Got through Halo 2's library levels. Getting close to the end now. I'm kinda excited to hit Halo 3 again. 
### January 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Time to pray and reflect.
2. A warm house
3. A quite weekend at home (mostly)

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty treats.

Entry

Yesterday I banged my head against password issues mostly. It was not a terribly happy day. During my one on one I discussed Receptor with Todd and I came to the agreement that my normal mantra is probably the correct answer here: Be evolutionary not revolutionary. There is little in receptor that could not be done in Client API, so I may just start inching things that direction. 
After work I decided to buckle down on the bulk spice storage objective for this quarter and ease off the sextant book for a bit. I got the box designed in SCAD and was able to see how things would break down between the amish containers and mason jars. I chatted with Brady a little about how it was going to work and got some times to try to ensure I am designing something strong enough. I did a pair of trial prints of the divider connectors, but I am probably not going to actually be able to act on these designs for a bit. My general rule is that I don't work in a garage lower than 50f. Last night it was 35 and we are heading into negative temps over the weekend. So I'll be waiting for a warmer day. So we finished the evening off by playing some more FFVII and eating some cake since Lucy was still recovering and our plans to travel this weekend were completely shot.
### January 15

Things I'm thankful for


1. A warm house
2. Being safe at home
3. The courage to go out when it is negative 10f.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Went out side in negative 10f as well.

Entry

Friday I finished up some of the dependabot stuff I was doing and worked on documentation. After work we shoveled snow. 0f and an hour of shoveling. I fiddled away on designing some hangers to hold up our window screens in the basement, off the floor so they are kept safe during the winter. Did some reading.
Saturday morning I slept in. We all did. Lucy slept in our bed most of the night. She did all 3 nights. We were kind of ok with this since it was the coldest nights of the year. It was nice knowing she was safe and warm. But of course it wasn't the best nights' sleep as a result. For breakfast I made "marmalade scones" which were our typical cranberry scone with the sugar replaced with marmalade. It wasn't to bad. I then did the rest of my hour of prayer before having lunch and getting ready to go to the DnD campaign. The session went well. I lead a conga line of skeletons as part of it. Quite amusing. Came home. Played with Lucy. Fought with my printer. Chatted with Amanda. Read some, coded some. A nice evening.
Sunday there was no church due to it getting down to -18.8 over night. We all just bunkered down and stayed inside. I took video games as the discipline I relaxed that day. I may some day choose another but thus far that has been my biggest desire. I played a lot of "the guild 2" in the morning. Having fun so far. A bit more to learn about it I'd say. Had lunch. Played some mine craft. I thought Drake was going to be available, I thought so as well of Mark and Emily. But alas, no. It was just me. I refined the route through the nether for getting to the strong hold. I also dug down and found an entrance into said strong hold. That should get us into a position where we can go assaulting that strong hold soon. But those good things aside my heart is heavy. This suggestion of minecraft seems to have been a flop. Drake mostly played on his own because he didn't want the game spoiled by playing it with experienced players. So over Christmas break when I played on the team server I mostly played alone because there was no one to play with. Justin is not at all experienced with playing with other people and was regularly leaving everyone behind. Todd is not picking up the game quickly. And on top of that the amount of time we need is typically not what we have available on a wednesday morning. So my heart is heavy. This seemed like it was going to be an exciting option but it has kinda flopped. I'm going to keep my chin up and hope for the best. We may not stick to minecraft on wednesday mornings. We shall see. After all the gaming I made us some ball park brat pizza and we had some family board game time. We each choose one game and played one round of each. It was a good time. Lucy happened to win all 3 games. Technically we all tied the first 2, which was quite surprising. We played primeclimb, Lucy only had to get one of her tokens to the top, Megan and I managed to get both of our second pieces in on the same turn Lucy got her one in, so she won, by turn count we tied. Next was Racko, same thing. Lucy got Racko first, I got it off of a lucky draw, and Megan got it off of the card I discarded. Remarkable. Last was Chutes and ladders, no such luck there. xD
### January 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Warm bed at night
2. Peace about our windows what ever happens
3. A productive day

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is trying to make sex better for both of us.

Entry

Yesterday at work I mostly worked on documentation and then assisted with on boarding of a new employee. After work was pretty busy. Had supper, walked off to my Exodus90 fraternity meeting, got home, exercised, showed, knew Megan, went to bed. Busy but a good day.
### January 17th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lucy's injuries were minor
2. A good time last night with Lucy
3. Good feelings about this cycle

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is hopeful for more children.

Entry

Yesterday at work I gave an introduction to Optim about what we will be doing during this cycle for the chassis migration. The meeting went will I think, except for Todd derailing us towards the end with fancy bells and whistles in the stretch goals.
After work I was going to exercise but then Megan reminded me that more shoveling could be done so I took that opportunity. I started Reading Aristotle. This is the end of the trial that the "Dev Ops hand book" started me on. "Dev Ops Hand Book" -> "Phoenix Project" -> "The Goal" -> "Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics". Once I complete this I will start the path the other direction, and see if I can trace the flow of reason from one book to the next.
After shoveling we had supper and then it was Papa time! I tried to give her the whole night last night. I got about 2 hours in. The end of the first hour happened when tried to climb down in the net and my weight was enough to pull the platform out from the wall exposing a screw on which she got a gash and got hung on her underwear. I attended to the platform and Megan and I together attended to the gash on her back and Lucy and I played minecraft setting up pens for all the colors of the sheep. We stopped when I was starting to get nauseous. So it was about 2 hours instead of almost 3. But still, it was a long papa time and I was focused on her almost all of it. I consider that a success. And I'm glad her injuries were minor.
### January 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. An imune system
2. A new giant pile of snow to play on!
3. Progress on Client API

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes great food from scratch

Entry

Yesterday I tried to start on my various pitches but Optim shot me down since they want to wait till Friday and Ops doesn't have my grafana instance up yet. So I worked on prep work for a different pitch that I am a support role in. iOS is going to add new events, so I cleaned up a bunch of Client API's process around said events. It was a good day.
At various points through out the day yesterday I was working on a great new usage of Homeassistant, and that is controlling volume on our devices. I'm hoping I'll be able to control more than just volume, potentially even turning off screens and such, but for now even remote control of volume is a nice feature.
After work I did not exercise as it was a cubbies night. We had supper, Megan dropped Lucy off and I read the sextant hand book. After a few more pages of the part I was in I eventually realized that this book is purely about using the sextant and now about navigation. It was not going to teach me how to find lat/lon, just how to do sightings. So I am done with the book. I have started picking up videos and other tutorials instead to teach me how to find Lat/Lon. Making great progress. I've also realized that my current sextant is basically just a decorative piece. I don't think it will work well for most things. So I might pick up a new sextant or I might consider this whole endeavor a success (since I have learned to use said sextant) and call it a day. Departing with my sextant if not the box. It's a cool box.
Megan and Lucy played on the new snow mountain that sanford created yesterday. That was exciting. Lucy got home just before it was time to game with Ben so I didn't join them. Probably for next papa time we'll do the snow mountain and we'll keep doing it until it starts to melt.
### January 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Knowledge about fixing my printer
2. Progress on FFVII
3. Good unit tests.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Thinks while playing video games.

Entry

Yesterday I was plucking away at my refactor of the activity log route till my one on one in which I realized that I want tests but I do not want to write them in tape. So After my one on one I switched gears to migrating client API to using Vi test. That was the rest of my day.
After work I was not feeling up to shoveling since I had a sore throat, which is doing much better today. So I'm leaving it till maybe this evening. I spent a bit fiddling with my printer to get it running again. Attached the casement window screens to the ceiling as I had planned, success! Played Lucy's new paw patrol game with her. It was a pure luck game so I was happy when she won. We had supper and I continued to fiddle with my printer until it was time for video game night. Got through the rest of the cloud-sephiroth back story and are now in pursuit. At bed time we kicked Lucy out of our bed as we are trying to gently get her to sleep in her bed more. Megan and I are both getting pretty tired of her presence as she's getting big and flails. Though we may just grin and bear it these next two nights as we get down into the -10s again. 
### January 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Staying warm over the weekend
2. Lovely weather returning
3. A good DnD session

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is one sexy woman.

Entry

Friday I finished the Vi Test migration and got access to Grafana. Success! That evening I officially declared myself done with learning to sextant. I put in the effort to read up on how to do all the calculations and realized these are non-trivial and inevitably require a look up table. So I am content with declaring my sextant decorative and saturday morning I printed a hook for it to go on the wall and look pretty. Thus the adventure started 10 years ago draws to a close. The last dangling thread from my hopes and dreams of being on the logos hope has finally been put to rest.
After I started the printer going Saturday morning Megan was gone so I was alone with Lucy. She was being a twerp but clearly wanted connection time, something Megan and I are getting better about noticing. So I invited her to help me do some food preservation work. We need to finish the potatoes before the start going bad, they are all starting to bud. So Lucy cleaned some potatoes while I finished work on the pumpkins. We are almost done with our food preservation for the year. After that Lucy got working on some craft things while I cleaned floors. We also got a new tablet for the kitchen which I tried to get loaded with google play services and failed. I would get it working monday morning, this morning, but it frustrated me all weekend.
After that it was game time. Went to play DnD with friends. We finished off the fortress we had been in and in the process I got a pet, a small troll named "grong" who I will bring with me since he swore to a life of good. I now have a pack mule.
Sunday was pretty relaxed. I managed to get most of my prayer time in before leaving for church. I recited scripture while I drove to and from church which works well as a lower focused prayer option but I'm still working on things that count. In between services I managed to socialize a little bit. That was good. And then after church we got home and relaxed. I played "The Guild 2" for a while. Getting close to end game now. I've been told I can have an affair but I haven't been able to figure out how. Apparently it is an end game activity. I should be there next week, that is, of course, assuming we aren't CAMPING! :D We hope to have a good snow camp this coming weekend. Everything is looking pretty good. And best case scenario Megan will be pregnant and won't have to deal with her period while camping. After supper we had family game night. Megan summarized it well when she said that Lucy is loving game night and that's it's biggest draw. Megan and I may not be super excited, but we are having fun and we aren't board which is about what we might expect from an average movie night. But unlike movie night there aren't any negatives of Lucy not having fun so the whole experience over all is MUCH better than a movie night and we are digging it.
### January 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good prayer time yesterday
2. A bit of time to sleep in yesterday morning
3. A productive day yesterday day

Thing I love about Megan: 
Brings me hope.

Entry

Yesterday I worked and figuring out what needs to be done for grafana, and in the afternoon I worked on some unit tests. By my mind was lagging something fierce and so I did not accomplish much to my disappointment. I switched to reading "The Staff Engineer's Path" at the end of the day hoping I could be some what productive there.
After work I started working on the budget which is much over due. Got all the transactions loaded and amazon transactions resolved before it was time to eat supper. After supper walked to St. Agnes and had our fraternity meeting then we went to the Newman center for a group holy hour. It was good. I closely observed the 14 stages of the cross. Something I hadn't done so deeply before. There is certainly a lot more there that I could meditate on. It struck me how poorly I knew the story. I didn't recall that Jesus stumbled 3 times, I knew the once, but I forgot the other 2. After the holy hour I came home, did my exercise, showed with Megan and then gave her a back rub to call it an evening. 
### January 24th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A completed budget
2. A good time out on the snow mountain with Lucy
3. A sharp mind

Thing I love about Megan: 
Does a good job with our money.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on grafana and tests some more. Relatively normal day. After work Lucy and I went straight out to the snow mountain and stayed there for about an hour and a half. It was a good time. I tried digging a sled slope but over all sledding doesn't seem to be Lucy's thing so I think I'll give up on such an activity, at least for now. After that we had supper and I worked on the budget for a bit till it was ready to pass off to Megan. Then I worked on designing a shelf bracket for our bulk spice storage in the stairwell. I made a parametric shelf bracket since I wasn't convinced on some of the sizing yet. I would also like to be able to do some level of structural analysis of these brackets so we can know just how much they can support. Still figuring out how I would go about such. I finished the bracket but it was to late to print it so I switched over to DnD accounting for a bit. The spread sheet is coming along. I suspect I'll have it ready by the next session.
### January 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Good designs
2. Getting through tough and boring things
3. Progress on my pitches

Thing I love about Megan: 
Managed a "meatless" (in the Catholic sense) day yesterday for me.

Entry

Yesterday I started working on some grafana stuff before shifting gears to help Adam Kile of team Optim. We ended up in a 3 hour marathon doing the chassis migration on Data-integrator. That was rough. But productive. So I am grateful we got so far. We worked straight through lunch so I got off work at 4. First thing I did was weight test a 3D printed shelving bracket I had made. It supported 15lbs before breaking, I needed a minimum of 10 and a preferred amount of 20. Noting how it broke, I started the printer going on another one printed in a different orientation. This time the layer lines would be going through the screw that holds up the bracket rather than the screw splitting the grain. While that printed I did my exercise, 40 boring minutes on the exercise bike. We had supper and I worked on my spread sheet for DnD xp and money accounting. Finished that and sent it to the group. I was a bit rushed at this point to test my new bracket. It broke at 30lbs instead of 15lbs, which is great news! The bracket is strong enough for my needs. I had about 20 minutes at this point to shower and get down to my computer for gaming with Ben. We finished Halo2. Started Halo3. I've only done Halo3 once so I'm excited to go through the story again.
### January 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A successful snow camping
2. A fun DnD campaign
3. Good family game nights

Thing I love about Megan: 
Encourages the playing of games.

Entry

I apparently forgot to write on Friday morning. So Thursday at work I got started with the Chassis migration with team NeXT. And some other bits of work, specifically tests of client api. After work I processed some potatoes and did other helpful things I think until it was time for supper. After supper I did what I could to get to video game night ASAP so I could indulge in some candy. It was nice to have candy after having skipped it Exodus90.
The work on Friday was mostly patching up the missing tests on client api to get the PR up for review. After work we gathered ourselves up and went camping. We managed to get to our site while there was still some light, though it was getting dark and when we finally ate supper it was pretty dark and that made serving a challenge. But we cuddled up in our tent and everything went pretty well I would say. It was a much better night's sleep than our first time snow camping. And we walked away from the experience thinking "We could have stayed two nights."
Saturday after camping was a busy time trying to get a few things done before heading off to DnD. And then DnD went late. It was 10 by the time I left. And then Brody tailed me home since a mountain lion had been seen in our neighborhood. Got home and went straight to bed.
Sunday was pretty relaxed. I wanted to sleep in but Lucy was in our bed so I was up at 7:30. Did a few things, not much productive, and then went and woke up Megan and Lucy so we could get off to church. Lucy was being a bit of a butt during church and when I asked for a hug before I left she licked my face and laughed instead. I just walked away. After hearing all about children minding their parents in little house on the prairie I'm getting even more fed up with some of Lucy's behavior. Things like "Stop, please stop touching my lips" I say and she, while bringing her fingers back, declares "I'm not squeezing, I'm just touching" And I exasperated say that is exactly what I asked her to stop doing. Or she wants a snack, we say no, she demands, and Megan says "fine, 5 Cheerios" to which Lucy says "6 Cherrios" cause she always has to have it her way. Or "Please pick up the rocks before watching paw patrol." to which she bargins back "How about I just pick my episode and then pick up the rocks and then come back." Because she always has to have it her way. This is not good behavior. We are going to need to do something about it or she's going to struggle mightily with friends growing up.
Between services I came home and did my holy hour and played a little "The Guild 2" and then I went back church for a soup and bread lunch to learn about the upcoming Ethiopia missions trip. Then we came home. Took a nap. Knew Megan. Played more of the guild 2. I'm getting close to being done with the game. It has a lot of rough edges and game mechanics that rub me wrong. But I want to try to get through this current round at very least. Concluded the day's game play to make supper and do the dishes. After supper it was family game night. We played "Little Polka Dot", a game I made up on the spot I called "battle dice", and a round of "Sequoia". Lucy continues her miraculous winning streak. After games we relaxed for the evening. I tried to book craft but Lucy wanted to sit on my lap. So off came the book. I played minecraft for a bit to try to get the subway station cart dispenser working. With that done I closed up minecraft and played some factorio for the remainder of the evening. Mostly some chores to try to recover some lost ground with my base but then I also tackled my blues being my current bottle neck. I got that sorted and was half way through uranium ammo by the end of the evening. It was enjoyable playing a little factorio. I'll be glad for the conclusion of Exodus90 to be able to enjoy some of my games again.
### January 30th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Checking items off of my quarterly goals.
2. Busy days keeping me pure.
3. A lovely wife.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Wants to tap our maple tree. Exciting!

Entry

Yesterday I discussed with a number of people the various dashboards out there for grafana so I could confidently move forward keeping or deleting them. I also had a hour and a half long code review with Emily and Drake about a client API PR. It contains a litany of wishlist items so I am stoked to get it through PQA and on to QA now. Here's hoping it gets through QA just fine. 
After work was a busy evening. I put away the last of the dehydrated potatoes, marking the official conclusion of our food preservation for 2023. I also was trying to get my printer to boot, no luck there. I was trying to figure out why the kitchen tablet wouldn't open google docs anymore. Lastly I opened, cleaned, and lubricated the food dehydrator. I was hoping to find whatever it was that was making the grindy sound. But alas I think the fan is simple un-balanced and I lack the tools necessary to fix that issue. I got the dehydrator back together in time for supper and then headed off to my fraternity meeting. At which I discovered I had no data. My phone having recently been dropped I was concerned my cellular modem was dying or something. I perseverated on that till I got home and Megan suggested checking my data usage. That was the issue. For some reason my phone had burned all it's data. I don't know why. 
So I looked into unlimited plans from our cellular carrier while I did my exercise biking. I also looked into items for DnD. Took my shower, came down and managed to fix the tablet and get my printer rolling. So I started the evening everything was broken, and now things were mostly working. All was well in the land of Denmark. Discussed with Megan in descent length at that point the possibility of taping our silver maple tree and making some home grown maple syrup. 
### January 31st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Motivation to do my exercise.
2. A good time during Lulu time last night.
3. Progress on the spice project, even if I spooked myself.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is learning to better communicate with me about our intimacy. 

Entry

Yesterday I mostly was focused on a change to Client API that I wanted to get pushed out. It was harrowing but we got it done by the end of the day.
After work first thing I did my exercise. This was a little delayed because it was the first Tuesday that I hadn't been climbing on a snow mountain or shoveling snow. So I hadn't entered the exercises into my phone yet. Then we had supper. Then it was Lulu time. We played party and then played Iota. It was a good time and I stayed pretty focused on her for most of it. After that I was excited to cut wood for the spice shelves in the stairs. But I discovered my brackets were much bigger than I thought. I paniced. Did I screw up the measurements? I had been printing these brackets all day and I was concerned I screwed them up. Documentation ma dudes. I hadn't screwed it up, I had just forgotten what the plan was. The brackets were large enough to handle quart jars. Further I'm going to cut the wood for the shelves to be 4" deep, that is a sensible depth that won't leave the next owner of the house wondering "what on earth is the depth of this shelf?" But, I haven't printed any more brackets because I planned to include a small hook at the end of the bracket in case we wanted to hang something, lights, a sign, etc, from those brackets at any point in the future. Had some time with Megan before going to bed. Finished "Little house in the big woods" before going to bed.
### February 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Solving problems and fix outages.
2. Cleaner Client API code.
3. Hope for tree sap.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes doing fun things.

Entry

Yesterday at work was a bit hectic. My client API changes caused an outage in uninstall notifications. The problem was a misunderstanding of how the clients communicate with Client API. Specifically Android clients don't call the uninstall route, they just push an uninstall event. Further I was also not sending a notification on uninstall events getting writen to com hub. The two of those together made for a particularly insidious snare.
After work we were going to tap our maple tree first thing, but Lucy was reading books so I did my exercise. exercise biking is very dull. After the exercising we tapped the tree and Lucy and I went to the hardware store to get tubes. We returned, connected the tubes to the taps and went inside. We had supper, for which I was keenly hungry since it had been a fasting day. After supper I cut some shelves and brought them in to test. To my dismay the resulting shelf was angled somewhat downward, no good. I'm going to need to redesign the brackets to make sure that the way I screw them into the wall does not effect their verticality. After that played through 2 missions of Halo 3 with Ben. We are now onto the first flood mission of Halo 3. I'm looking forward to getting on with things and getting to the ark already. 
### February 2nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A well designed shelf bracket
2. Some good time playing video games
3. Time with Lucy well spent

Thing I love about Megan: 
Ever strives for good food.

Entry

Yesterday I was a bit anchor-less. I was digging into one issue and then realized it should probably be a cool down concern so I turned to Todd and asked what I should focus on. He recommended grafana related things so I'm digging into the remaining chassis metrics.
After work I spent the whole time till supper working on the design for my shelf bracket. I have "solved" the shelf bracket "problem" with this design since it is parametric and I can simple request a shelf of xyz dimensions. So I was happy about that. This morning I tested the newly printed bracket and found that it was able to support 65lbs, maxing out my test rig. I got a picture of it hanging there with all that weight on it. Wowzers. Anyway, after designing and kicking off the print we had supper. While Megan cleaned up from supper and did a few other tasks Lucy and I played in the basement. We played till she spun me a bunch and then I wasn't feeling so great immediately after supper. But it was about time to go up at that point anyway. We played through a bit more FFVII and had an overall pleasant evening. 
### February 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Successful designs and prints
2. Fun times with friends playing DND. 
3. Fun times playing minecraft and factorio.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Appreciates the house projects that I do.

Entry

Friday I hacked on chassis metrics, helped Jeff with some migration issues, and started working on converting client api over to Vod. After work we didn't end up going on the owl prowl because of sickness and fog. So I did my exercise. It was the first time I had done upper body weight lifting in quite some time and my upper body still hurts. Probably a good sign but I'll be happy when I can extend my left arm without it hurting. After exercise we had supper and I did one last re-design on my new shelf brackets. I added a small hook to the end of them so that they could lights from them when the shelves are done and on the wall. Got those printing but it wasn't until later in the evening that I got that done so I didn't get anything printed that evening. The day was also the day I relaxed shows as my discipline of choice for the celebration of the presentation of Jesus. It was enjoyable watching some shows through out the day. I had a momentary recoil when I went to watch the news. "Do I really want this?" There is something enjoyable about being blissfully ignorant. 
Saturday morning was a slow start. Not for me. I was up at 8 and mopping the floor. I made breakfast. Everything was going well but Megan and Lucy did not wake for a long time so my day didn't really start until about 11. I had decided not to do the bathroom fan yet and wait for a day that I would have more time. In addition to other things I wanted to also get a hair cut. The most important thing I did was cut and sand shelves for the bulk spice storage in the basement stairs. That evening it was fine for DnD. The session went well and I got out a 9:30. I had some good conversation and got to be kind of paladin-y. :success:
Sunday was a bright an early morning as I had rehearsal and wanted to get to my holy hour in before church as it makes the rest of the day go much easier. Church was good. Got home and played some games and relaxed. Played minecraft since Drake said he would be on. But he never showed. Non-the less I got the farm moved. I thought it looked ugly in the front yard. I like beautiful things. Played a little factorio too. Through out the day I had been playing an Idle Miner game. I was grossed out by it pretty quick. I hate these types of games that seem purely engineered to wring money out of you. I am fine with people making a living, gotta eat, but making progress absurdly slow or premium just is not my style. So I've uninstalled it. 
We had bbq pizza for supper and I made the bbq sauce from scratch. It was fairly easy to make something decently good. However, for 2 cubes of tomato paste we did not get a lot of sauce so if we want to genuinely do this we'll need to have a lot more tomatoes to justify it. Never the less, it was nice to see that it is not a difficult challenge. Though getting it nice and smooth may be a greater challenge. That's probably where the skinning and seeding of the tomatoes comes in and I'm keen on doing that. 
Megan complimented me for the house projects I have done. Specifically she highlighted my follow through. Definitely one of the aspects that a lot of men tend to struggle with. This came about when a friend admired the over door book shelf that runs the length of our living room (stopping short of where my computer is in the SW corner). The friend lamented that they also needed more book shelves but her husband doesn't want to buy any because he could build them for cheaper, and so now the wife is of the opinion that this means the shelves will never get done. So I am glad that I am able to follow through on actually providing nice things for my family and I am particularly happy that Megan likes the things I have done.
### February 6th 

Things I'm thankful for


1. A productive day
2. A bike computer
3. Momentum on designing a processor.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Teaches Lucy so well.

Entry

Yesterday I spent basically the whole day pairing. We got a lot of good work done. I am pleased. 
After work I got my new bike computer onto the exercise bike. To my dismay the little radio does not transmit that far and so the read out can't be on the front with my handle bars. This still isn't the worst as I can chuck it in the basket on the back and still get milage, but if I want live speed I'm going to need to print a bracket to attach it some where close to the back that I can read. But that aside I got 9.8m in last night. It's nice to be able to see what I am actually doing instead of peddling into oblivion. Had supper, went to my Exodus90 fraternity meeting. Came home and Megan left to go hang out with Amanda for a while. Lucy watched shows while I did some modeling work. I was busily designing a new rake attachment for Lucy's rake. I broke said rake last summer and I promised her I would fix it. I learned how to use "multmatrix" in order to skew the "cubes" from side to side and make the fan effect I needed for the rake. Pleased with what I had so far I called it an evening then and switched to a different project. I finally have gotten off the ground creating a processor in cedar logic. Technically I haven't gotten any further than I have done previously, but I have a much better understanding of where I am going now so I am excited. Like completing Nanowrimo this has been a long time dream of mine. I realize that Cedar Logic isn't strictly speaking the best program for this. But it is a good start and a personal objective. I have ideas for more interesting processors but I will wait to do those till I am working with something more real, like HDL. There is just something intoxicating about designing hardware.
### February 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good time with Lulu time last night
2. Enough motivation to get through my exercises
3. Building excitement for spring!

Thing I love about Megan: 
I'm still happy about that complement from a few days ago. :)

Entry

Yesterday I hammered on things with Jeff again. Got a version 2 of the chassis released since we introduced some breaking changes. All employee meeting. A little digging into an error. Pretty good day.
After work I did my exercise. I need to step up my game on that exercise or stop. Perhaps that's to extreme. But I'm not sure how much mediocre exercise is helping me. I need to find the motivation to push to exhaustion so I can see actual progress in my exercise. Anyway, after that we had corn dogs and I probably at to much. This morning I was not yet hungry when I ate breakfast. But the corn dogs were so good! Then it was papa time. We did library, and had dinner, and then played in her play room for a while. Then we cleaned for the robot and I plucked away at my processor in cedar for a little while. Got the ALU finished and was trying to get the registers setup when bed time ticked around.
### February 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Patience
2. Endurance
3. Sleep

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes tasty food

Entry

Yesterday was an exhausting one. All this week I have been pairing with Jeff on a daily basis as we work through not only Victory's migration but changes to chassis as well. I feel like some one walking a dog whose bigger than I am and trying to hold back said dog as he strains to go forward. A lot of the ideas Jeff is proposing I like and approve of, but I fear that the way he's going about them will result in push back or make problems. I realize now that I do not actually have a mind set of "Go fast and break things." I am much more a "go as fast as possible without breaking more than necessary." Specifically Jeff drops code whose purpose he doesn't know. I do this to. But I would not do it as part of the chassis migration. I would go with what is known to work, and then in a separate PR remove code whose purpose is unknown and see if anything breaks. This hit home with my changes last week to Client API that caused an outage of uninstall notifications. I don't like my changes being any bigger than necessary.
Towards the end of the day I was exhausted and so I sat down to read for a bit. While reading I was inspired to action. My recent Client API changes were refactors. They specifically *did not* change anything that mattered to people outside of the company. While it is good to keep your house clean, it did make me pause on my desire to rewrite Client API. Todd has said it to me several times, "what is the business case?" and so I am trying to see that objectively. Having recently seen the 3.7k line "memberDatasource.ts" file of the member MS, I am realizing that Client API aint half bad. So I thought about my ideas for a Client API rewrite and one that is notable was my idea for remote configuration management. I wrote up a document explaining my idea and have passed it to Andrew Keller of Team Frontline for review. 
After work we made supper, Lucy went to cubbies, we had some time together, I bucked up the motivation to have a cold shower (only 52 days left in exodus 90), picked up Lucy, played Halo 3 with Ben. 
### February 09

Things I'm thankful for


1. AWG moving forward on a solid plan for API versioning
2. God's patience and guidance yesterday.
3. Good conversation with Justin

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes good care of Lucy.

Entry

Yesterday started the day in an exhausting way as I discussed things with Justin and Jeff. Hashing through all that was happening. It was some good conversation with Justin so I am grateful for that. But it was none the less exhausting.
After work I cleared the printer and started the next print. I've got the plastic now so I'm pumping out shelf brackets as fast as I can. I'm averaging 3-4 a day. This makes it slower going than I would like but they are coming along. But I'm realizing I will also need to print some wall anchors so I'm going to need to parameterize and load up wall anchors into the printer for this specific application. Some of the brackets will unfortunately not be over studs so I will have to deal with that issue.
Anyway. The original plan for the day had been to have my mom stay the night. But when we returned from Gamelan we found Lucy with a fever at home. So my mom retired in hopes of spending the night next week. After the things mentioned above and before supper I cuddled Lucy to help her wake up. After supper I worked on my processor design in Cedar logic. I believe I have a completed processor at this point. I have figured I will need to do some sort of connection to RAM which I have plotted this morning, and I need to write up a batch of tests. But I am nearing the completion of this project as well. February should see both the spices and the processor get checked off. :success:
After that we played some FFVII. We tried to recruit Yuffie, encountered her at least 4 times and failed to say the right things each time. It was hilarious really. I'm glad we aren't looking up any guide to this because there is a lot of joy to be had in the running around trying to figure it out. 
### February 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Patience
2. Prayer
3. Hopes and dreams of water features in our yard

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a calming presence in my life.

Entry

Friday did some things with grafana and such. Had a long discussion with Jeff and Jaron about a change they want to put into chassis and how I do want the change they are providing but I don't want to create new problems. (conversation continued this morning, I'm already exhausted.) After work I did my exercise and worked on my processor. I got the RAM added and wrote the first two sets of tests. Testing immediate, copies, and ALU functionality. I just need to write the jump test and the stress test and I'll be able to say I've accomplished it. Once I've completed the tests I'm going to do some refactoring of my work so that it is pretty and then I think I'll print it out and stick it in my bullet journal for a permanent remembrance. 
Saturday morning Lucy was tossing in our bed so I left 20 minutes earlier than I had planned. It ended up being a good thing because I was struggling to get all of my prayer time in Saturday. I prayed, made breakfast. Went upstairs and cuddled while the muffins cooked. And then we came down. Lucy was very excited to have muffins and then she discovered the rhubarb chunks in it and was very sad. Utterly heart broken. It was kind of sad to see. She had something else and Megan and I continued enjoying the muffins. After that it was time to clean up. Lucy and Megan cleaned Lucy's bed room and then started on the monumental task of cleaning the craft room up. It took a while, in which I did a through cleaning of the floors in the other rooms. We got the whole upstairs cleaned up which was great and so as a reward I pumped up the bouncy castle for Lucy.
After lunch we headed down to Sioux City so I could attend a presentation about water features. We hope to put one in this summer. A small one, probably using Lucy's old kiddy pool as the liner, and planting some plants in there and putting a couple gold fish to eat the mosquitos. We discussed it a bunch on the way home. Then we had supper and I went of to DnD. We managed to make it through our encounter just in the nick of time to get home promptly. 
Sunday went to church and Lucy was super cuddly. It was concerning. Was she sick? After church it took some doing but we got her to agree to lie down and take a rest. She slept for over 3 hours. That night we went to the Gutzmans for a super bowl party and Lucy threw up in the middle of the floor. Clearly she wasn't feeling great. So Megan took her home and I hung around for a little while longer to finish the game I was playing. We relaxed a little bit at home before calling it a night. Megan and Lucy were resting on the sofa when I got home. Hopefully no one else gets sick.
### February 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Tyler joining exodus90
2. New paradigm for budget fleshing out a bit.
3. Good reading while exercising

Thing I love about Megan: 
Worked on the adoption profile last night.

Entry

Spent another day working on things with Jeff Ward. We went back and forth for like an hour trying to figure out how to not making a breaking change and eventually he convinced me that we had to and I felt satisfied that we had put due diligence in. After he convinced me though I convinced him that if we are going to make a breaking change, lets make all the breaking changes and he refactored feature flags into a proper interface with concrete classes and such. That's a good change, I'm hoping we can see more of it.
After work I had a moment of "man, how do I usually get my exercise in before my fraternity meeting?" And then I remembered I don't! Silly me. It was kinda a shame as I kinda wanted to go biking outside for my exercise since it was a nice day. But at this rate I'll have some opportunity to do such in march. I'll have to bare that in mind. Now that I know approximately how far I travel when I bike on my exercise bike thanks to the bike computer I should be able to switch between the two without issue. 
Had supper. Went to fraternity meeting. Tyler Gutzman has decided to join us for the Lenten period. He confessed that he recently had an issue with pornography and that motivated him to come to the group. I pray that I'll be able to deepen my friendship with him as a product of this.
After I got home and did my exercise and took my cold shower. Wednesday marks the halfway point so I'll be happy when there are more days behind than before me on this challenge. As I was walking home from the fraternity meeting though Alan. Alan asked for Amanda's number after he and had had some good conversation with her on Sunday. I told him I would pass the message on. He's not an amazing fellow but he is a nice guy. I sent the message to Amanda and shared as much about him as I knew. She didn't immediately say no, I suspect she'll ask more questions to night over ice cream sundays.
After those things I worked on the budget for the rest of the evening. I made it now handle getting data from venmo. We are approaching a world where all our transactions are accounted for and we should be able to have record of each of our accounts and where they differ we can try to figure out why. Hope to finish that tonight. oh wait, valentines day tonight. uuuuh. Friday?
### February 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good valentine's day evening with Megan.
2. Another round of hope for children.
3. A day that wasn't to exhausting at work. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Arranges for us to have date nights. :)

Entry

Yesterday there was more discussion around chassis but it wasn't to exhausting this time. The rest of the day went by with out major incident until the evening when I spotted a data integrator outage. Got a bandaid in place for the overnight.
After work Megan and I got dressed all fancy and dropped Lucy off at Amanda's so we could go have a dinner date at Hartford. We had about a 20 minute wait and chatted a little while we waited. Megan was over all a bit quiet. She thinks she might be pregnant so is effecting her mood somewhat. We are very hopeful. Sabrina said she had a dream that Megan is pregnant with twins. Also very hopeful. We shall see. After our date we came home and Amanda and Lucy came over for ice-cream sundaes. We chatted, I gave Alan Amanda's phone number. We'll see where that one goes. Amanda said that unless she has a reason not to go on a few dates with some one at this point she's not turning anyone down. So Alan's got a shot. 
### February 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Budget done for January
2. A good nights sleep
3. Progress in weight objectives

Thing I love about Megan: 
May be pregnant.

Entry

Yesterday work on chassis in the morning, and recovering from the data-integrator outage. Did dashboards in the afternoon. Over lunch we took Mezzo to the Vet. He had to get a steroid shot, drops in his ears, spots shaved to allow his sores to heal, lots of things. Hopefully it will help him start to feel better soon. We'll have to be much more careful about him come summer and not let him outside at all I think, or get him some flea and tick treatments. We'll see.
After work I did my exercise. Reading the staff engineer's path while biking isn't to bad. Then we had supper and Lucy was asleep before supper, we woke her for supper, then she fell asleep again during supper. She was clearly still recovering a bit. So we didn't end up having family board game night. I instead focused on the budget. I'm trying to bring it into a position where it can accurately tell us how much money we actually have. This is challenging with credit cards since they don't actually provide positions. Similar with petty cash. So it will just be traditional bank accounts that we will have accurate positions on. This makes a certain level of sense since credit cards don't actually reflect our available money. I would like to improve this system a bit so that I can take the tedium of fetching the data from the various banks out and then take out the tedium of looking up the amazon purchases. But, one step at a time.
### February 16th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nearly proven processor
2. Shelf brackets finished printing
3. A bright sunny day with snow!

Thing I love about Megan: 
Takes Lucy on adventures.

Entry

Yesterday I hacked on grafana and did some other things. Nothing terribly notable at work. After work I made sure I had wall anchors ready to be printed. I put up a few more shelf brackets. I have put up all brackets that I can for the moment. All the brackets that connect to studs are up. Today I'll start printing wall anchors so I can put up the brackets that don't have a stud. After that I designed a d10 times 100 die to bring to DnD. Then we'll no longer have to keep straight which is the ones, tens, and hundreds die when we roll a d1000. Lastly I wrote the tests for testing jumping on my processor. Most of them worked, but something is going wrong with the tests towards the end. To figure out what I am going to need to add some debug outputs so I can see what the test is that I am actually testing. So I didn't quite finish that task, but hope to tonight. It was then time to switch over to FFVII. We got through the rest of RedXIII's backstory and met up with Vincent Valentine. Hopefully next week we'll get to rocket town.
### February 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My processor done
2. A good walk with Megan
3. The feeling of spring

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has fun dreams of micro schooling

Entry

Friday I did a number of things. Working on grafana 10 and it's new systems for alerting was one of the more interesting ones though. I will need to create videos explaining how to do various cool things. After work Megan and Lucy were still in Sioux City so I took the opportunity to get my exercise done in peace and quiet before they got home. I very nearly violated my discipline of no un necessary phone usage to listen to the No Agenda podcast, but I contained myself and listened to some music instead. I'm on day 50 today of exodus 90, I'll be happy when it is done.
I forget what all I did after exercise but I know I was printing wall anchors at this point and I believe I test fitted some of them. Pleased with the result I continued with the prints as they were. Worked some more on the processor and got the jump test passing and got the stress test up and running. 
Saturday morning got up early, got through most of my holy hour and then made scones. While they cooked I worked on refactoring my processor to be printer friendly. It ended up being for naught as Cedar crashed while I was futzing around and I didn't have time to restart any of the work before I had to leave. Finished my holy hour in the car ride to my mom's. It was moving day at last! I got there around 12:45, a few minutes late, and we went first thing to get lunch. We then moved my mom's bedroom set to a friend of her's, a process that took almost 2 hours, and then we could get started in earnest. I didn't leave until almost 8. Things slowed down quite a bit after a while as there was a lot of fussing about this and that. Mom was overwhelmed it was easy to see. By the time I got home I was exhausted and took a hot shower.
Sunday morning we got up and going at 8 and out the door. Church was good. Lucy was a enjoyable level of cuddly instead of a concerning level of cuddly. After church I finished my holy hour and watched some videos explaining Nicomachean ethics, which I am currently reading. I could feel the text just rolling off of me having no effect so I watched a few videos to give me some more depth in hopes I could get more purchase on the ideas. It has indeed helped, even in retrospect it has helped, which is good. 
After church I let Megan choose which discipline I should relax. Her period arrived and so we were both a bit grumpy that there was no child yet this month. So she said alcohol and that evening I made a pitcher of hard lemonade. But this meant I was not relaxing video games. I also refused to do anything physically demanding. My body needed some rest after a day of moving yesterday. So I finished my processor refactoring. Re-ran all the tests. Printed it out and pasted a copy in my bullet journal. I also committed a copy here but it looks like I failed to push that commit. I'll do that tonight. But I'm psyched. That was a loooooooong time objective. Very much like NaNoWriMo. Since I was probably 16 I have been wanting to make a processor since I was 18 and found cedar logic I would say I've wanted to do it specifically there. I have ideas I want to play around with for other designs but those I now feel fine doing in a real hardware language like HDL.
I had a moment when listening to some of the comentary on Nicomachean ethics where I realized "if I want friends, I do need to work for it." And I knew Derek had commented about he had some clean up to do before Laural got home. Since I didn't relax video games I felt free to offer myself. That was a bonified good that exodus 90 brought about (and kind of created?). He didn't end up needing assistance, it wasn't really a lot, but I'm sure it was a positive impact that I offered. Played some games for family board game night and then called it an evening.
### February 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Moving on to prep work for painting the basement stair well. 
2. 50 days down in exodus 90.
3. Lucy likes biking.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is working on our adoption profile.

Entry

Yesterday I did a lot of thinking (and second guessing) in the morning. In the afternoon I worked on some nice relaxing grafana alerts. After work I started removing the shelf brackets from the stair well wall. Didn't quite finish before supper. Went to my fraternity, came home and Lucy and I went to the hardware store. We picked up some supplies I'll need for finishing this project and came home. Did not go back to the project but rather did my exercise. Took a shower. And finally was able to get back to the stair well. Finished removing the brackets and started spackling holes. I got a good distance on the holes but I want to also install a metal bracket on the edge to protect the sheet rock. So it will take several days of working here and there to get it all prepared. Painting is of course merely the last step in the process. Anyway, spackled until it was time for bed.
### February 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. My mother's life calming down soon
2. An extra afternoon that happened to be available
3. Everything working out schedule wise

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is a kind helpful woman.

Entry

Yesterday I got some discussions and grafana alerts done. It ended up only being a half day though. Just before bed on Monday Brady recommended that I go help Mom on Tuesday afternoon. I discussed it with Megan and realized that since I took the whole day off on Friday but don't actually need the morning off I could flex those hours to Tuesday afternoon. Cleared this with Todd and we headed out after lunch. It was another fairly exhausting day. But I'm sure that it would have nearly killed my mother since Megan and I effectively doubled her work force since she also had her friend Marie there. We barely completed it by 4:30 and so there is no way my Mom would have completed it by such a time on her own. So it was very good that we came. 
Lucy fell asleep on the way home. Megan and I had a pleasant drive home as a result. (for the most part. the sun was at a horrid position most of the time for me.) Lucy was pretty tired and we actually moved her inside and she went back to sleeping. But we had supper and then it was time for Papa time. After which I arranged to have play games with Ben. Since my mom is coming tomorrow to spend the evening I switched to Tuesday for game night so that we could focus in on my mom before she leaves for Decorah. We finished up Halo 3 and will proceed to Halo 4 next week. Not sure what we are going to do after Halo 4 though. I'm also curious how much longer we will continue playing games together. Perhaps it is time to evolve to something else?
### February 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice relaxing evening
2. More craft supplies for Lucy
3. A flexible schedule.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has handled the cat well.

Entry

Yesterday metrics and such and had a long donut chat with Mike Lenkner. As it happens he and I seem to get together about once a year. I'll need to re-read "Extreme Ownership" the book he recommended to me one of these days. 
After work we loaded up and headed out to Cafe Brule promptly. We needed to get there, order, and eat with enough time to allow Lucy and Megan to get to Cubbies. After they left I sat and chatted with my mom until 7:40 when Megan came back and picked us up after picking up Lucy. That was the majority of the evening. We sat and chatted with my Mom. She also gave Lucy her belated valentine's day present which was more crafting supplies. Lucy, after seeing it all, promptly said "Time to get to work!" and started crafting a butterfly. Got to bed a little late. 
### February 23rd

Things I'm thankful for


1. Our kitty healing up
2. A good last hurrah with Gigi before she moved to Decorah
3. Warm weather returning

Thing I love about Megan: 
Suggested we tap our maple tree

Entry

Yesterday I got distracted by mandatory side quests. Very suddenly. I had to deal with two deployment outages. After work was more time hanging out with Gigi. Mostly for Lucy though. Particularly after supper where Lucy and Gigi played up stairs while Megan and I worked on our adoption profile. Hopefully we can finish that up in short order. After that we swapped family board game and video game nights. This way we could play board games while Gigi is here and video games when she's gone. It was a good last hurrah with mom before she heads out to live with Brady in Decorah. She was sad to go this morning, being 5 hours away now. But we'll still see her plenty I'm sure. 
### February 26th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A clean car
2. Some new directions to try from the doctor
3. Nice warm weather

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is wise and encouraged Lucy to wait to go iceskating till this coming weekend.

Entry

Friday was a short work day since I only had the morning. I worked on documentation. After work we headed off to Orange City to meet with Dr. Hanson. He gave some advice and prescribed Megan and fertility drug and a visit to sanford to do an glucose test. I was informed that there was a message waiting for me in sanford my chart and so now I know of some supplements that I can take that will hopefully aid in my sperm morphology. All these things to hopefully aid in the chances of getting pregnant next go round.
After that we came home. I did my exercise and worked on the basement stair well preparing it for the coming painting. Then we chatted with Amanda. There wasn't a lot of news on the Alan front. But it's still early so we shall see. Perhaps she won't talk much around me. After that I pulled out the cold store and started rumaging through hard drives trying to find a little extra space to dump the back ups that I have floundering on udgard-host. I also found some missing files. That's pretty nice. Specifically I found our missing minecrafts, but that wasn't until saturday so I'll circle back to that in a moment. I started making lists of all the files in the drives in the cold store as well. This way we can search the cold store without having to pull it up.
Lucy was a monster at bed time. She staunchly refused to go potty and was still not ready for bed by the time Megan and I had finished reading. She was screaming and yelling and we finally got her to sit on my lap on the toilet for 10 seconds and then get her dressed. But it was not pleasant for anyone and then she didn't want to go to bed, she wanted to go down stairs. Just adamantly refusing to do anything we asked of her. 
Saturday morning got up bright and early to head off to mens breakfast with my Exodus group. It was pleasant getting to sit and chat with the other men. Then we went and had a group holy hour in the Neuman Center. By the time I got home Megan and Lucy were still slumbering so I joined them to round out my 8 hours of sleep that were cut a little short by the fighting going to bed. Did more work on the backups process. Found the homestead saves of minecraft and showed Lucy the world that her Mama and Papa had made long before she was born in 2016. 
Had lunch, took nap. went out and washed Urbosa who was in desperate need of being cleaned. The dirt was sheeting off just from the rinsing. It was such a nice day. After the cleaning I went down into the basement and started disassembling Lucy's ride on car to try to figure out what was wrong with it. I think the cat may have peed some where in the basement that we have yet to find because I was getting strong whifs of it and it was making me nauseous. Anyway, I traced the problem to her power switch later that evening. I ordered another swtich. 
Also that evening we had our first bike ride of the year. We rode to VHS for a "night of music in vermillion" which was a musical verity show. It was some good exposure for Lucy to see all the kinds of music. It did also inform us that the children's choir is kinda crap and we will definitely not be pursuing that for Lucy. But the show choirs were all fun to watch.
Sunday was rough. Another early morning for one, for two there has been a communication break down between myself and Noah. He was making changes on the board both during rehearsal, not so big a deal, and during the service, quite a big deal. I chatted about it with Derek. I had kinda hoped I would be able to escape by simply saying that "oh. perhaps I don't have the ear for this any more." but Derek, unbeknownst to him what I was thinking and planning, affirmed that I did a good Job. I felt it was God stepping in and saying "no, you don't get to take the easy way out. Do this right." so I am praying a lot about what I need to say to Noah and how to say it right and with grace. 
After church we hurried home, I ate lunch quickly, and got to my nap so I could get off to DnD at 1. It was a fun session with the quote of the session being "Keep your lips above your hips!" Which resulted from me stumbling through the a similar statement. I was trying to say that as long as people kept their head above the cloud of poison that was at waist height, they would be fine. This came out as "keep your mouths above your hips" which quickly turned into the catchier "keep your lips above your hips." 
Came home, made pizza. Kept the hard drive transfer of files process rolling. We played some more FFVII and finally got our last characters, I picked up Yuffie while waiting for Megan to be ready and then we picked up Cid and made it through rocket town before calling it an evening. I commented at one point that the ability to swap out characters in the wild or mid fight actually makes a huge difference to the nature of the game. In FFXII we actually cared about all 6 party members because we would swap them out as some got spent. Since we can't do that in FFVII, we don't tend to care about them. The result is that Cloud, Tifa, and Aries are the only characters we really get to see. That's a valuable piece of insight for the future. If the other characters matter, you care about them. If they don't, you don't. 
### February 27th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Warm weather yesterday
2. 3 months porn free
3. Lectures to watch while I bike.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is warming to her bike.

Entry

Yesterday I got stymied in several directions. It was not happy. 
After work I installed the bike computer on my bike. I had a moment of "I don't approve of this naming, it is not a bike computer, it is a finite state machine." But I think finite state machines can still count as computers. :shrug: Then supper, fraternity meeting, exercise bike. Watched a lecture on singletons while I biked which was good. Got me through the exercise biking with relative ease. Then I sanded the parts of the basement stair case I was spackling. Hopefully I can start the painting process on that this weekend. Showered and did as much as I could to make coming to bed an easy activity for Megan, including putting the sheets on the bed and making the whole bed. Then Lucy threw my plans under the bus when she made Megan responsible for cleaning her teeth. :eyeroll: But still got some intimacy. Switched back to shorts for sleeping. It was 70f yesterday, though today it's supposed get down to 10f. Exciting week!
### February 28th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A warm house
2. Good times with Lucy
3. Hopefully an end to my hard drive issues for a while.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Likes us making noodles.

Yesterday I mostly worked on documentation. I tried to upgrade client api to the latest chassis but all it's tests are consistently blowing up. I'm going to have to circle back to it during cool down. After work I went straight into Papa time since we were going to make noodles for supper. So Lucy and I got our aprons on and we made some egg noodle dough. Then we paused while that went into it's rest period and went down to the basement and started putting some gutters on the wall. We got one gutter up and then the dough was done resting and we went upstairs. Then we up and made the noodles. Then we came back down and finished the gutters. Lucy was very excited to have the gutters up to roll balls down. It was a good papa time. 
Then was supper. Then we ran to the hardware store to pick up some spackle. I spackled a little bit. I think I've got all the spackle up I want so now a final pass with the sander should get me in order. I then did my exercise. And finished the evening off by finishing my recent rummaging through the cold store. I've got the contents of all the drives recorded and have freed up some 600gb from udgard-host. Then we went to bed.
### February 29th

Things I'm thankful for


1. My plants a growing
2. Spring a coming
3. Another round of hope for a child.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Can support her friends.

Entry

Yesterday I worked first on documentation and then on the script for re-importing grafana so we can keep it git-backed. After work I went and did my exercise. Despite hating every minute of it I got through all 40 minutes and had biked further than I ever had before. I think I probably have one more indoor biking left, after that I may be able to bike outside. Here's hoping. After biking I did a little more sanding and then I did taping and cleaning. I'm almost ready to begin painting. I'll probably start tomorrow night. I want to do a little more cleaning tonight and anyway it's video game night tonight. After cleaning we had supper, I searched for my brass cleaner to no avail, I wonder where it could have got to. I'll probably just skip cleaning the railing holders at this point. Finished the evening off with Video games with Ben and then chatted with Megan about her friend Ina who seems to have had a miscarriage. 
### March 1st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Only 30 days left in Exodus 90
2. A pleasant walk in the warming air
3. A good start on the painting project

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is supportive of me in my projects.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly worked on the re-import script. I had some good satisfaction when I did it in a technically very smart way to avoid ugly patterns. I even named the pattern I was using correctly: Strategy Pattern. 
After work I continued the clean up of the basement stair well in preparation for the painting of such. The cleaning went quickly and so I began the painting. I paused to eat supper and then returned to it. I got the first coat on to everywhere that I had planned on doing that evening. There were some parts of course that I skipped since I decided I should only remove one railing at a time. I'll come back to the right side of the stair well soon. Finished up by 7:30 so we were still on time for video game night. We got the key of the ancients and made our way to the temple of the ancients. We then had the most conveniently placed save point we've ever had and called it a night at 9:31. :success:
### March 4th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Stair well project nearing completion
2. Stair well looking goooooood
3. Lucy did great iceskating

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is an encouragement

Entry

Friday I pounded on getting grafana up and running. We managed it just before the end of the day but I did work through lunch. After work I did another round of painting. I added texture to the wall to better hide the addition of the metal strip. It went a long way. The result is looking pretty dang good. Just one more coat of paint or so till all the painting is done. Also did my exercise. Then I was left with not much left to do for the evening. I was tired and what I most wanted was to just sit and relax with some Factorio. But no, I'm still in exodus 90. I was getting quite tired of it at that point. But I muscled through. Did the budget, got it all done and ready to pass on to Megan. I was searching for more to do at that point so I also cleaned the floors getting them ready for the robot, mixed ingredients for Saturday breakfast and still headed up to bed early.
Saturday was a busy day. Woke up, had my holy hour, made breakfast, painted the stair well, mopped the floors, took a nap, and then Lucy and I were off to go ice skating. I was a little concerned by the time we arrived that we only had an hour. But that ended up being ok. Lucy took to it well. She was right away walking on her skates after I put them on her and was able to keep her self upright while we got to one of the skating helper walker things. She had a great time for about half an hour but then was getting distraught. So we took a break and she said she wanted to go home. I offered to get her a treat and see if we could go back out. She bit. I got a kit kat and we went back out for another 20 minutes, almost doubling our time. She was able to walk about 15 ish feet with no assistance and could push the skating helper probably 20 feet. She was doing rather well for her first time on ice. I was pleased. When she said she was ready to go home at 7 till I was plenty alright with that statement. So we headed home.
When I got home I rested for a little and then I went off to confessional to fulfill the "Go to confessional" action item for exodus 90. I prayed that he lord keep me open to whatever was going to take place in that room but it was honestly kinda awkward. I did my best to not let theology be a stumbling block but I also of course didn't want to say I believed something that I didn't believe. The main point that felt so weird to me is the priest's absolvement of my sins. As he himself said I could appeal to God directly in the protestant tradition so in my view he wasn't actually absolving me but I was willing to accept the affirmation. That's where I left it. I did my quick penance and headed home. I am still open to Catholicism, I am not going to cut myself off from the Lord, but it still seems so strange and like it is tacking on a bunch of unnecessary things. The biggest hangup I still have is the whole veneration of Mary. I feel like I'd be burned at the stake for suggesting "guys, she was just another woman like you or me." where this is a problem is it starts to feel like Catholicism is kinda of the cult of Mary.
After confessional I came home did a few more chores before heading out to DnD at 5. It was a good session, we accomplished quite a bit. Didn't quite get to level 9. which is funny since we haven't had the long rest to get up to level 8 yet. xD
By Sunday morning I hadn't decided on a discipline to relax. I had given Megan the opportunity to choose and she didn't have any specific requests. It was between shows and video games. I ended up deciding video games as I realized I needed to take a break. I had stated that with the shows I could potentially still do productive things like finish the painting or work on Lucy's car. That was the clincher. It was Sabbath, I needed to take a break. So I choose video games. It ended up being a bit of a family activity as the majority of the time I was playing games Lucy was also sitting on my lap. Played factorio, stopped for lunch and a nap, factorio, stopped for some intimate time with Megan, played Factorio, stopped for a walk and garden planning, cleaned the kitchen and got the pizza dough rising, played factorio, had supper and played some family board games. The conclusion of the evening though was not more factorio but rather some Minecraft, which Lucy told me she enjoys more anyway. I played with Emily and Todd. I showed Todd the circuitry for the auto wheat farm. We both gave Emily feed back on her terraced garden. I finished out the evening by starting work on what I called the "tenements" which was a brutalist architecture building just in our front yard. I designed it to be as soul sucking as possible and named it the "Jira Tenements" we'll see what people think of them when they are done.
Honestly I'm feeling better about the rest of exodus 90 now that I have had a little time to rest and relax with some video games. Only 27 days left. 
### March 5th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Completing the stair well project
2. A warm cozy bed
3. Only 26 days of exodus left.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is all on board with gardening.

Entry

Yesterday cleaned up some grafana things and worked on docs. There was some debugging in there to but it didn't feel like that productive of a day. *sigh*
After work I made supper so we could get on it promptly. At least I started it. We had hot dogs. Megan added green beans to the mix. We had a nice leisurely supper as a result though since we didn't try to accomplish things in that same time slot. I went of to my fraternity meeting and Megan took Lucy to tumbling. It was a short fraternity meeting since many guys were absent. Came home. Went down and did the final coat of paint. I wasn't sure of it at the time but feeling it this morning I feel pretty confident now that it is was the final coat. I'll wrap up those projects tonight. After painting I exercised. After exercise I took one of my 12 remaining cold showers. While I may have been invigorated by the time to relax and play some Factorio on Sunday, I am still looking forward to being free of this "unusual freedom". Then I worked on the lights under the shelves while Megan showered. And we concluded the day watching the rest of the vegetable academy videos. We aren't yet sure if we want to take the plunge and purchase the content this year, I'm leaning towards yes, but we are feeling excited. 
### March 6th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Excitement around garden planning
2. Lucy's Tulips coming up
3. Urbosa's Auto loan paid off. 

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has grand dreams of vegetable farming. 

Entry

Yesterday did some editing and grafana cleaning and preparing my review video. Towards the end of the day I had another good conversation with Justin. He had made a statement about how he was not quite so work focused when he was in a relationship. That sparked the obvious question about how his current relationship was going. I had suspicious based on his wording and he confirmed that yes he is single again. We chatted for a bit about that and theology, as theology seems to be what is tripping up his relationships recently. It was a good talk and I feel like I am making good in roads with him. Also in this conversation was some time for co-mentoring. I'm trying to help him see other people's perspectives and he's helping me become more informed about our technology. I would not have suspected I would land on that side of this equation.
After work Megan and I went out to plot our plots. We decided on some 14 garden plots. We decided on our plants and where we wanted to plant them. This should be a pretty exciting summer of gardening! I'm leaning towards we should take the plunge and buy the seed to table course and turbo charge our gardening. We did a fair bit of math as well figuring out what how much we want to get of each thing. We shall see how it all pans out. 
Lucy was actually instrumental in super preparations last night. She did all the slicing of the keilbasa. That freed up a fair bit of Megan's time which was good as she and I were discussing numbers. After supper was papa time. Lucy wanted to play the "bucket" game as she called it where I came and purchased her while she sat in a bucket. And then I would carry her around. Then we played a game of her rolling balls down the gutters. I did a little cleaning of the stair well while she loaded up balls. Then we played crazy pillow then we played some minecraft. The minecraft was mostly me running around taking pictures of my and Megan's first world. I'm 140 pictures in and haven't even gotten to the nether or the other bases yet. 
So I didn't get to doing much cleaning and finishing on the stair well project so it's technically still not done. We'll see if I get to it tonight. It's taking second fiddle to the garden planning right now. 
### March 7th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Stair well project complete
2. A good day to go biking
3. Lots of good work yesterday

Thing I love about Megan: 
Gave me a back rub.

Entry

Yesterday in the morning I worked on my review video. It wasn't terribly inspired I feel but there wasn't a lot to talk about. Next cycle should be a lot more exciting as it will be the replacement of our logging system. Excited! After the review video I knocked out a bunch of small tasks, that felt good. 
After work we quickly got supper ready so that I could bike Lucy to church. This was great in that it allowed me to exercise in addition to dropping Lucy off. We a lotted a lot of time to achieve this but it ended up only taking me about 14 minutes to do. So in the future we'll allot 15 minutes to get there, only 5 more than driving. or probably 20 if we go as a family, 25 if we let Lucy bike some of it. I enjoyed it. It certainly is the better way to get my exercise than biking in the basement. 
After I got home I cleaned some. Paused for some time with Megan. Showed, and then finished cleaning up the stair well. That project is officially complete. At least the white paint part of it. There is still hopes to paint the stairs themselves, but that can wait. It's been a while since I've done a house project so this was good. Hopefully get back on that band wagon a bit. But with Gardening coming up that will again take up a large portion of my time. Anyway, finished the evening with some ODST with Ben.
### March 8th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A chance to see Dune 2 in cinema.
2. A good conversation with Justin
3. My and Megan's first Minecraft world capture as pictures to remember it by.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Arranged for baby sitting so we could have a date night to see Dune.

Entry

Yesterday at work I did some PQA and worked on relieving some of the pressure around service meta. But the most interesting part of the day was when I was supposed to have a one on one with Todd but Todd was out. I was chatting with Justin so we ended up having a call and having a one on one of sorts instead. I view our chats as an iron sharpens iron sort of exchange, but I would say I'm probably benefiting from them more than Justin is. 
Left work a little early to go see dune 2. It was a very enjoyable movie. Was glad we went. They did a good job of capturing the weirdness of Dune and making it cool and interesting. After that we came home and skipped supper because neither of us were really hungry and Lucy had supper at Tiahrts. We decided to not play FFVII and instead played TotK since Dune was quite a heavy movie, and keeping track of everything was a lot of brain power. I finished taking pictures and then adding descriptions to said pictures of my and Megan's first minecraft world. I'm glad we'll have that saved for posterity. 
### March 11th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A new ceiling fan and light installed.
2. Good chat with Nathan
3. Only 20 days left of exodus 90.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Finds great deals on facebook market place

Entry

Friday did some tweaks to the service meta to hopefully make it less of a pain in the neck. And played some minecraft. I think it was the best Minecraft session we've had so far. I hope maybe we can do more of that before we call it quits. 
After work I did my exercise and then put together an estimate on how much we would expend on gardening related expenses. It was low enough that we felt like we could spare the funds and went ahead and bought a year's subscription to "Vegetable Academy". I also did some reading.
Saturday morning I made us some breakfast and did some reading while I waited for Megan and Lucy to wake. After breakfast I worked hard as I could getting the ceiling light in the bathroom changed. It hasn't worked since we moved in and for a few years we've had a light fixture we link on our amazon list. A few months ago we went ahead and bought said fixture and it has sat in the guest room since, taunting me. Well, I finally did it. I tore out the old lamp and put in the new one and all is well. Over all I'm quite pleased. I didn't get the night light in like we had hoped but it's still a pretty good setup. I may circle back to the night light later. I'd like to also get a sensor node in there and control the fan via home assistant so we could have automations running on the fan. Chatted with Nathan through a lot of the fan replacement. It was a good catchup. Talked about catholicism and jobs and such. 
After that I showed and took a nap and headed off to DnD. We had a combat but were over all just trying to sneak by to level 9 before we took a long rest. Took us the rest of the session to find a treasure to get us over the hump but we eventually managed! Just barely too. 
Sunday morning I got up early so I could get through my holy hour before rehearsal in the morning. It ended up being not terribly different from my normal wake up time despite the DST change over. Noah was much more receptive yesterday morning. I think the realization that he might loose another op gave him a moment of pause. He was also a bundle of nerves since he was going to be preaching. We'll see how he behaves when he's back to leading music. After church we stopped by Runnings and picked up some peat pots and bumped into the Faders for a bit. Came home and I relaxed with some Factorio. In the late afternoon we stopped the games and went out and did some gardening. We watered some plants, I dug a compost hole, and most notably we planted some spinach. Made some pizza, made some bread as well since we weren't going to have sufficient bread to get through the week. We played some board games. It was probably the lowest of the board game weeks. I thought GPS would be a fun simple one but Lucy rapidly lost interest and we just rushed through the game. Hopefully next week we'll have a little more enjoyable games. 
I am noticing that I was also getting jealous of time spent doing anything other than playing video games. *sigh* what this really means is I ought to do something other than video games next week. In a way it is becoming an idol again in the ever seeking the sweet release of the drug. I'll need to for-go it the remaining 2 sundays.
### March 12th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Convictions
2. Fun things for kids to play with
3. A nice night to go bike riding.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is my excuse to have a hot shower some times.

Entry

Yesterday I dealt with DST issues. I hope that by the time some grand child or beyond reads these pages that we will have done away with this institution. Did some other Client API clean up along those lines. Waiting for Raoul to be done fixing grafana.
After work we grilled for supper and then I headed out to the fraternity meeting. It was a good meeting. Only 2 more remain! Then I went for a bike ride outside. That was enjoyable. I didn't push myself as hard as I do when I bike in the basement so I'll need to work on that, but it was a good bike ride non-the-less. Got almost 10 miles in and enjoyed being out and around rather than cooped up. After the bike ride I worked on getting the block printing working on openscad. I think I'll have some nice characters for that here soon so I can start making some more pavers. Then I did some reading. I forgot to shower during this time so when I commented that I was going to read for the remaining 20 minutes of the evening Megan asked if I had showered yet. Not being sweaty after the bike ride I had not. So I went and showered with her. That leaves me with at most 8 cold showers remaining. Only 19 days left.
### March 13th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A fun time at the park with Lucy
2. Holding to convictions
3. Exciting ideas for Lucy's ride on car.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Makes us tasty food.

Entry

Yesterday at work I wanted to get through a lot of Client API PRs but staging blew up and all of my PR's just piled into a back log. Sad day! Hopefully today we'll be able to get them out the door.
After work we went straight into papa time. Lucy and I biked off to the Austin elemetry playground which Lucy had not yet been on. It was a good time. She really enjoyed having a whole new playground to explore. As did I. It was nice also being in the sun instead of the shade as we usually are in Jolly. Lucy biked some of the way there. She's doing quite well on her balance bike and I think she'll be ready for her big girl bike sooner than we thought. But I don't think we'll push the issue. Frankly her big girl bike won't fit on the bike rack on the trailer so it would mean the end of on off riding for her. But maybe she'll have a period where she does both? Anyway, after the playground we went to the hardware store and then headed home. While we were heading home said bike rack actually fell off on one side which slowed us a fair bit. Lucy managed to ride a good distance on her bike again but eventually I threw both her and the bike into the trailer and peddled home as quick as I could. Got home in time for supper.
After supper I worked on Lucy's ride on car. I validated every wire and everything seemed to check out. I finally tried one of the new switches we bought and sure enough, the old switch, despite showing 1ohm when switched to on, seems to be the source of the problems. I figured this out by putting one of the new switches in place. The problem though is the new switches are the wrong kind of switch. They automatically reset instead of toggling. So I have prepped a return and will pick up the right switch tomorrow. 
I was looking at Lucy's little car stereo (mono actually) and it occurs to me that having an audio jack isn't terribly helpful. Particularly now that we have fancy new phones that don't have audio jacks themselves. *eye roll* So I started thinking about how one might store music in the car permanently. I looked up Arduino MP3 players, but they all depend on external SD memory since the Arduino has only kb of memory and a MP3 is MB at least. But then I realized I could probably get by with just some Midi files and have the Arduino function as a synth! Then there will be a set of buttons that Lucy can press for different music. If I pull songs from vgmusic.com I'll even be able to have music Lucy knows. Should be fun! But I'm going to wait till after exodus 90 finishes for that. The first priority is just getting the car working again. Anyway, read to finish out the evening.
### March 14th

Things I'm thankful for


1. 6 PRs in one day!
2. Exercise via bike ride
3. 16 of exodus 90 remaining

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is encouraging.

Entry

Yesterday was a busy day! Got 6 PRs done despite hitting some snags along the way. A 7th didn't quite get pushed out but I'm hopeful it will be done early today.
After work I biked off to get some exercise. Topped at the hardware store to see if they had a switch for Lucy's car, close but no cigar. Continued my bike ride around town to get some exercise. Got home, had supper. Took Lucy out and checked both Runnings and O'Reily's to see if they had a switch that would work, again, no dice. I think though I have found one that will work on amazon, we shall see. I may also attempt to manufacture one myself. Got home and finished my holy hour. I had accidentally slept in yesterday morning. Bathed and it was time for games with Ben. Finished ODST. On to Halo 4 next week.
### March 15th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Overnight stability
2. Interesting problems
3. Happy Lucy

Thing I love about Megan: 
Has worked hard at being a good lover.

Entry

Yesterday at work Mark and I got a scaffolder update out the door. Unfortunately it blew up while I was off to Gamelan practice. It was rolled back and we tried to get it fixed up before the end of the day but it flopped. I'm going to re-consider the problem today.
Afterwork took a nap with Megan. Had some intimate time together. Her period had arrived, so sadly no baby this month, so we were a little more creative with our time. Our conversations about sex have definitely been helping both of us understand each other and our needs a little more. She has pushed herself to try harder and I can feel her effort. I am very glad.
After that I mostly worked on designing a saucer for our little 2" peat pots. I got way off into the weeds on the design though. The mathematics of it is much more intricate than I expected. I need to pull out pencil and paper this evening and chart out how it is supposed to work. Chat GPT helps some times, but some times it just gets things flat wrong. 
Got through the temple of the ancient's last night. We are closing in on the moment I have been waiting to see. I sure hope it doesn't traumatize Lucy to much, but Lucy already seems to handle death better than some people.
### March 18th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A nice relaxed weekend
2. A year coming to a conclusion
3. 13 days left of Exodus 90.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Knows how to incentivize Lucy.

Entry

Friday wasn't to bad. Was digging into why the scaffolder update broke windows and discovered other things so backed off from that scaffolder update. Going to try again after I've done a few other tasks to get the house in order. Fought the ender Dragon for team bonding time. We ended up also exploring an end city and found an Elytra which I duplicated so everyone could have one. Maybe we can setup an Elytra race course!
After work I got my pot saucer design completed. I then proceeded to attempt to print it but was having no luck with the ASA filament. Switched to PLA to late for me to try to print yet that evening. I did end up doing the transplanting so I needed something to put the little peat pots into so I put them on mason jar lids for the time being. It worked until I got saucers printed the next day.
Saturday was a busy day though it didn't feel like it at times. I started off doing half my holy hour and then made breakfast and mopped the wood floors. By the time I had finished those Megan and Lucy had come down. We ate breakfast and started our day. We quickly realized that we both wanted to go out to run some errands so we all went out. Came home. Did some spring cleaning. Chatted for a few hours with Brady as I cleaned the garage. Played Minecraft with Emily for a little while. Would love to play with some one else some time. Finished the evening with some reading.
Sunday was really relaxing. Running the sound in the morning wasn't to bad. Was pretty distracted by my choice to relax unnecessary phone usage. Read a lot of hack-a-day. But was responsible with my consumption and actually backed off for a little to do some more reading of "Staff Engineer's Path". Was fully present for family game night, I specifically did not pick up my phone at any time. But then after Lucy wanted to play a little Minecraft so I indulged her. 
### March 19th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Lovely little seedlings growing in my window sill.
2. Spring coming.
3. 12 days of exodus left.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Understands the value of scheduling.

Entry

Yesterday worked with Raoul on grafana's needs. I had a moment of terror when it seemed like OpenSearch was going to be no more usable that graylog was in grafana. Those fears were tempered when we got the Elastic Search plug in working for Open Search and some of the newer niceties came back into view. Other wise continued efforts to clean up Client API.
After work I repaired Lucy's fairy lights, had to remove one to get it to work but they now work. Success. Then supper and off to my fraternity meeting. Came home, exercised, got Lucy to watch a new show by watching one episode myself. Lucy now seems to be to the point where she wants to watch a lunch time show again. We will consider it. Then I bathed and we started watching our Gardening videos. Lucy and Megan had snacks and I just about wept from just wanting a few snacks. I am so tired of Exodus 90. At the start of this I was not opposed to doing it again next year, and while I will not rule out the possibility, it is going to take some convincing to get me to do such. I think I have gotten out of this what I will and a second year will have serious diminishing returns.
### March 20th

Things I'm thankful for


1. Gardening videos
2. A time to relax some disciplines
3. 11 days left of Exodus 90

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is great at planning

Entry

Yesterday I mostly cleaned up Client API. Still warm up so hoping to get some logs by the end of the week to actually work with. After work I did exercise. I took "Shows" as my discipline to relax and my performance while exercising was that much higher since I was that little bit distracted and wasn't wallowing in the misery of doing exercise. After that was papa time, we went to the park with the Blue slides. I continue to push Lucy on her ability to do things and she continues to grow. She is remarkably scared of heights it would seem after having zero fear of heights for much of her life. But she's growing in confidence and that's good. After that we had supper and Megan and I watched another Vegetable Academy video. We are still in the prep phase of the videos. Lots of content about self review and figuring out what we even want to cover yet. Ended the day with some nice Star Trek.
### March 21st

Things I'm thankful for


1. Getting through the zod migration for client api.
2. All the little seedlings planted!
3. 10 Days left in Exodus 90.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is one sexy lady.

Entry

Yesterday I mostly hammered on my zod migration. A fair bit of refactoring went into it as well to make it hopefully make more sense. Because it was a fasting day and I had a decent breakfast I just worked straight through lunch, not even taking a nap. I was curious how it would effect me. While lunch may be a good trigger for my nap, it was not what necessitated my nap. I ended up conking out around 3:40. But I still was able to get to my exercise early and was done by 5. After supper I took my shower and potted 29 peat pots and planted Romas, Tomatillos, Bell Pepers, Basil, and had a few left over so I planted marigolds in those. I carried them up and placed them on the guest bed facing the southern window there. Ben and I started Halo 4 last night. Boy you can tell it's from a different studio. Even though it's also for xbox 360 it's visuals are radically different. They feel much more generic.
### March 22nd

Things I'm thankful for


1. One more round of snow making the plants that have already come up look so starkly green.
2. A nice relaxing evening
3. 9 days of Exodus 90 left.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Is playing FFVII with me.

Entry

Yesterday did a smattering of things. Starting to dig in to the alerts right now. Move us off of graylog onto grafana. 
Afterwork I was feeling exhausted for some reason (In retrospect I might have been slightly sick) and so I was dragging. But we made egg rolls and I finally got around to synchronizing the media content of the tablets and Lucy's phone. Now we can depend on everything being on every device which will make our lives significantly easier. Lucy's phone though remains the only one with video games on it. We'll see if we can get a few good games on the tablets yet. After supper Megan and I watched some garden videos and my exhaustion had me falling asleep so we paused half way through the quite long lecture and switched to video games. It was the last family video game night where I don't get candy since we will be gone next Thursday. So close, just 9 days left. We got to "the scene" last night. The moment I have bene waiting for. Lucy didn't seem to be to traumatized by Aeris's death. I specifically sowed doubt into Megan's mind about whether or not Aeris actually died by referencing Chrono's death in Chrono Trigger. We are entering the final act of the game now. I look forward to seeing it's conclusion. 
### March 25th

Things I'm thankful for


1. A good planning weekend.
2. Excitement in developing solutions to singleton problems.
3. 6 days of Exodus left.

Thing I love about Megan: 
Loves planning.

Friday I made a new alert that covers all of Delta's routes in one fell swoop with Drake. During which I discovered that we cannot edit notification policies so we are a little limited on what we can do right now. I will need to work with Raoul to sort that issue. I worked through lunch so we could leave a little early and have a little more time at the cottage. That worked well. 
We chatted a little with Lucy on the way there about what the weekend would entail. She said she didn't remember the cottage but as soon as we were there she was quickly remembering all the things, like putting post it notes up on the walls. This year she put some of her own post it notes up as well. She was very excited but her excitement rapidly waned as Megan and I moved far to ponderously for her. But it is a time of review. We went through every aspect of our years, our quarters, our weekly institutions. We discussed why we did everything and decided on what we want to keep moving forward. It was a good review. It's nice to drop things that aren't sparking joy. (We also attempted to conceive while we were there. It would feel very funny and fitting for us to conceive a child on planning weekend)
Sunday we high tailed it out of there hoping to get to the baptisms at church, there were a lot of them. The weather wasn't great, nor were the roads, so we took it slow but got there just fine. We then went home ate and napped. After my nap I did some reading. One of my bullet journal tasks I only get to mark off if I finish "The Staff Engineer's Path" by Friday. I've got a chapter and a half left. I also spent a good deal of time working on my bullet journaling software. I said to Megan that I had done the equivalent of not accomplishing anything on my journal but have re-arranged all my craft supplies to make things very neatly laid out. In reality I was also working on a conceptual problem we've been having at work. I really like how things have changed in the software. It is more modularized and I've finally pulled the logic away from the data. This brings me one step closer to an idealized data driven version of this software. We'll see what happens going forward of course. I'm still thinking I would like to migrate this to javascript and have everything rendered in the browser, but we'll see. I need to do something to improve the flexibility of my render that's for sure.

Yesterday I hammered on the notification policies issue. Still no worky. Me very saddy. After work supper got delayed so I exercised first thing. Then went to the final fraternity meeting of the exodus 90 challenge. We'll have a potluck after Easter, but the challenge itself is officially wrapping up. I am so glad to be nearly done. Came home, had supper, took shower, attempt to conceive a child, watched garden video, worked on bullet journal. Got said bullet journal finished migrated over to my new style of doing things. It looks so nice. Several of the pages are now fully data driven. :success: This should reduce the number of errors that result from copy pasting code. Hopefully I can get around to making some new pages tonight.

Yesterday I banged my head on an IAP issue and then on the notification policies issue in grafana. It was not a good day.
After work I exercised quick. Actually my best exercise thus far. I managed to max out all of my exercise objectives for the quarter. That is cool thinking about it. Those objectives were higher than anything I had done before so it was a notable achievement. But if I'm going to stay motivated I'm going to need to figure out a reason to do my exercise. "because it's good for me" is not sufficient. After exercise was supper and then Papa time. We played crazy pillow twice and then we played some "A short hike" at Lucy's request. And then we played some "Tears of the Kingdom" where Lucy got to decide what were the things we were doing. After that we had our first video call with my Mom now living in Decorah.
