Pages that make me draw graphs. Like I did for weight training. What would be nice is to have it generate the grid automatically based on a starting and stopping value.

Cute out lines to fill in.

Fun little diagrams of the activity with dates and bubbles to fill in.

Rows to fill in with what I did with included date.

Grid of daily and weekly objectives

Daily planner? Not sure if it matters since I have moved to a more relaxed set of things for the week and not specific thing for each night.

"Season of" page

Goals page

Monthly recap page?

Some how hexagons?

Sunday Movie page
