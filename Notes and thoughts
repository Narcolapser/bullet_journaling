Pages that make me draw graphs. Like I did for weight training. What would be nice is to have it generate the grid automatically based on a starting and stopping value.

Cute out lines to fill in.

Fun little diagrams of the activity with dates and bubbles to fill in.

Daily planner? Not sure if it matters since I have moved to a more relaxed set of things for the week and not specific thing for each night.

Some how hexagons?


I should make a base method for getting the date range. I've got all these bits of repetitive code for getting sequences of dates. It would be nice to have a single method where I could define the start and end date and then you pass to it which days of the week you want.
